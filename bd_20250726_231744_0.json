Rather, much of the chaos, stress, and endless crises we read about daily can be traced back to a series of decisions made by the senior leadership team in NHS England (NHSE). These leadership choices have rippled across every trust, every specialism, and nearly every colleague I’ve met, shaping the daily experience of doctors, nurses, and allied health professionals in ways that are often detrimental to patient care. It is the NHS England leadership who either lobby Government for particular policies or are tasked with turning Government policy into reality and yet they are never held accountable and the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care catches a disproportionate amount of the flak. 1. The 2016 Contract and the Erosion of Continuity of Care Back in 2016, a new contract was imposed on resident doctors which was marketed (at least to the public) as an upgrade that would introduce a “seven-day NHS” and ensure consistent coverage throughout weekends. In practice, this was more about political optics than genuine improvement of patient outcomes. From my perspective, the most tangible change was that doctors suddenly found themselves spread more thinly across more days, with rota patterns becoming more erratic. One of the greatest casualties of this new arrangement has been continuity of care. Previously, teams were more stable. You’d have a consultant, registrar, senior house officer, and foundation doctor all working in tandem, often on a more predictable pattern. This allowed them to get to know each other’s strengths and weaknesses, to trust each other’s clinical judgements, and – crucially – to follow a cohort of patients through their admission, investigations, and treatments in a more cohesive manner. Patients benefited immensely from the stability of seeing familiar faces, and the medical teams built better rapport with them over time. After 2016, rotas were rejigged in the name of “efficiency,” with doctors spread out to ensure coverage for more days and more shift patterns. Whilst it might look good on a spreadsheet to have so many doctors rostered every day of the week, in practice it means patients are likely to see different doctors from one day to the next. As a result, the subtle nuances in a patient’s history can slip through the cracks. When I’m picking up a patient on the acute take whom I’ve never met before, and whose last review was by a completely different doctor on a different shift, there’s a real risk that vital details get lost in translation. It’s not that electronic patient records and handovers aren’t helpful; it’s that no system can replace the familiarity and context gained from following your patients day by day. Is this the fault of doctors? Not at all. We’re simply following the rota patterns allocated. The more fundamental issue is the design. And that design was orchestrated at the highest level by NHSE leadership, who prioritised a shiny political pledge over the realities of team-based medicine. Who were these leaders? Sir Bruce Keogh the then national medical director who was politicised for the benefit of the Government of the day. Sir Simon Stevens who enforced the imposition of this new contract dismissing the concerns raised by doctors and effectively ending negotiations. Danny Mortimer head of NHS Employers who lead the contract negotiations. Charlie Massey who was director general and advisor to Jeremy Hunt was then appointed CEO of the GMC , the doctor's regulator, and now also regulates Physician Associates. 2. The Decline in Ward-Based Teaching Another insidious effect of these contractual and rota changes has been the steady decline in the quality of ward-based teaching. In a system that’s perennially short-staffed, it’s all too common for planned teaching sessions to be cancelled at the last minute because of service pressures. Moreover, when teaching does go ahead, it’s increasingly dedicated to what many of us would call “soft” subjects. Instead of diving into in-depth clinical topics like chronic kidney disease management, pharmacology of drugs used in parkinsons disease, or the latest use of immunological therapies in autoimmune conditions, we’re herded into sessions on “resilience” and “leadership.” Now, I’m not suggesting that resilience or leadership are entirely without merit. Doctors do need to know how to manage stress, work with teams, and navigate complicated interpersonal dynamics. However, the pendulum has swung so far in the direction of these generic sessions that we’re missing out on the bread-and-butter clinical teachings that are vital to our competence. It is through competence and confidence that doctors will feel more resilient in the face of overwhelming sick patients. Ward-based teaching has always been one of the best ways to learn because it’s relevant, patient-centred, and practical. But the reality is that consultants are under such immense pressure to clear wards, handle overflowing clinics, and meet targets that there’s little time to do comprehensive bedside teaching for residents. The ward round becomes a fragmented task and finish rush rather than a learning opportunity. This is a shared experience up and down the entire country which can only be ascribed to national directive and another example of NHSE’s leadership pushing for throughput without properly considering the knock-on effects. They’ll issue edicts and guidelines about the importance of leadership and resilience, but they fail to protect time and resources for the fundamental clinical teaching that’s crucial for safe patient care. If you think things are bad now, you're in for a shock in 5-10 years time when standards will plummet even faster. Read this thread on the doctor's reddit - we are now in the ludicrous position where serious and time critical interventions like chest drains are just not being taught to doctors with many expecting not to learn the skill even by the time they are consultants. 3. The Disruptive Nature of Rotational Training One of the toughest aspects of training in the NHS – especially as a resident doctor – is the constant rotation between different departments, hospitals, or trusts. Typically, you might rotate every 4, 6, or 12 months, depending on your training pathway. The logic behind this system is superficial in theory: by rotating, resident doctors can gain a wide range of experiences and specialities, broadening their skill sets and understanding of medicine. However, the disruption this causes in team cohesion, patient care, and even mundane organisational processes can’t be overstated. Every time a doctor moves to a new rotation, they face a steep learning curve: Getting to know a whole new set of colleagues, from consultants and registrars down to nurses, ward clerks, and healthcare assistants. It is commonplace for entire teams to never even learn the names of each other. If you can't even be bothered to learn the name of each other, can you imagine how bothered you are to teach them the skills necessary to develop? Learning the physical layout of the new hospital, which can be labyrinthine. (There’s nothing quite like being bleary-eyed at 3am and utterly lost between wards because a sign for “Ward 14B” was missing.) Discovering the local policies and protocols, which vary surprisingly even within the same trust. One hospital might require you to book emergency theatre slots (CEPOD) via an online form, another might insist you bleep the on-call anaesthetist, and sometimes it's left unsaid who is responsible for liaising with a theatre manager which you can imagine causes operational chaos. This lack of standardisation across trusts and even across departments within the same trust can lead to delays in patient care. In an ideal world, there’d be national policies with clear, uniform guidelines on how to do something as critical as arranging an urgent theatre slot. Instead, you have local idiosyncrasies that waste time and can put patients at risk. As if that weren’t bad enough, rotational training also means that just as you start to gel with your team, you’re whisked away to another department. The result is a perpetual sense of upheaval and less invested team dynamics. Strong teams depend on trust and familiarity – intangible qualities that build over time. By forcing doctors to move on before that trust can fully cement, we end up with a series of disjointed groups that never quite learn to function at their best. The British Medical Association (BMA) have frequently and consistently asked for better training to make more efficient and productive doctors and this includes the infamous 2008 vote where they lobbied to cap the intake of students and ban new medical schools from opening. The more cynical commentators often cite this as typical protectonism to limit supply but the sensible arguments are there for all to see and indeed are being proven today by the mass doctor unemployment . The BMA has consistently asked for improvements, whether that’s prioritising clinical teaching, better induction processes, or uniform protocols across trusts. But the evidence is clear that the decision making and leadership of NHS England has been in direct conflict with the consultants who used to lead services and the experiences of resident doctors and look where that has brought us but more importantly I'll show you where this is about to take us. 4. Strikes, the Annual Winter Crisis, Morale and Retention Every winter, we hear about the NHS being on the brink. We see photos of patients stuck on trolleys in corridors, wait times rocketing, and discharges delayed. For some reason, NHSE leadership will seize on the nearest explanation that absolves them of responsibility as if Winter is an unpredictable event. NHS England's Chris Hopson blamed increased demand on flu and covid in 2023 rather than identifying the issues on capacity and providing solutions. Recently, they’ve pointed their fingers at strike action, implying that the workforce’s decision to withdraw labour was unreasonable and triggered the crisis, as if they were unaware of the year on year results of the National NHS Staff Survey showing only 69% think their immediate manager works together to come to a shared understanding of problems, 54% were satisfied with the recognition they get for good work, 33% felt that their work was valued, 31% were satisfied with pay, 51% felt involved in deciding on changes, 55% feel able to make improvements happen, 50% were confident that their organisation would address their concerns, and 46% feel able to meet the demands put on them. But if you compare the timeline, these crises occur year after year, well before any mention of industrial action. Even in 2025, which saw no major strikes at crucial junctures, we had a winter crisis that rivalled previous years. The pattern is clear: The absolute number of GPs has fallen by 12% in the last 14 years , the bottlenecks in A&E, the lack of social care support for step-down discharges, and the chronic underinvestment in infrastructure don’t spontaneously emerge because of a few strike days. They are structural and longstanding. Strikes, as disruptive as they may appear from the outside, are a symptom of deeper dysfunction, not the root cause. Doctors and other healthcare workers don’t strike lightly. They do so because they’ve exhausted other avenues for achieving safe staffing levels, fair pay, and workable conditions that ultimately serve patients better. Yet NHSE’s leadership often opts to frame these strikes as reckless or as the singular culprit for all that ails the NHS, rather than confront the uncomfortable truth that the system’s design is fundamentally flawed. The NHS Long term workforce plan retention section produces a fascinating rabbit hole that says an awful lot but does almost nothing. It talks about the \"NHS People Promise\" and links to \" Retention hub: Looking after our people \" which links to \" Improving staff retention: a guide for line managers and employers \" which links to this toolkit which in the \"application\" slide for examples to use the first link doesn't work , the second link is behind a pay wall , the third link cycles back round to policy-speake rather than concrete examples. Essentially it all boils down to, listen to your staff and be compassionate. But that is never translated into reality because there are no real examples of how to do this for managers and there is a culture set by the leaders of NHS England to not listen to their staff but to protect the reputation and integrity of the brand the \"NHS\". 5. NHSE Leadership’s Silence on Real Issues and Diversionary Tactics The most galling aspect of NHSE’s leadership, in my opinion, is how selective they can be with their activism. When a crisis is unfolding every winter in our hospitals, with staff stretched beyond capacity and patients receiving suboptimal care, we often hear very little from the top ranks. The National Medical Director and other high-profile figures often provide generic soundbites urging staff to “pull together” or promising to “review the data.” Yet, when it comes to the policies they actively promote and the paper trail leads squarely to their feet which are under criticism by doctors en masse sounding the alarm bell, they suddenly find their voice. A recent example is the coordinated response to a poorly written article in The Times, which criticised the debate around physician associates (PAs) and how toxic it had become on social media. NHS England’s leadership jumped on this, issuing statements about the need for civility and respect in debate. Here you can see the National Medical Director at NHSE Steven Powis 's post on X and Chief Workforce officer Navina Evans ' post on X . Both posts are filled with responses from the public and doctors alike pulling apart the article in The Times and providing evidence and context that is conveniently left out. Let’s be clear: civility is important. No one wants a rancorous, abusive conversation dominating professional circles. However, there’s a glaring problem here. The underlying issue with the deployment of PAs isn’t whether doctors are being polite enough in their discussions; it’s that these professionals, as they currently stand, are comparatively undertrained, and are being used as a substitute for fully qualified doctors in some settings. This can undermine the quality of care that patients receive and places an unfair burden on the PAs themselves, who aren’t equipped with the same level of clinical experience as doctors yet are expected to shoulder significant responsibilities. The fact that NHSE leadership coordinated a rapid response to defend the introduction of PAs, but remains conspicuously reticent on the core complaints behind ongoing winter crises or the eroding quality of training, speaks volumes about their priorities. Rather than addressing the legitimate concerns – which range from the safety implications of substituting doctors with less trained staff, to how this shift might exacerbate existing staffing shortages by diluting the workforce structure – they focus on condemning the “toxic debate.” It’s an exercise in misdirection that doesn’t solve any of the real problems. The whole experiment of associate professionals is laced with outrageous lies, deceptions, and espionage which continues to incite the medical profession. For example, there was a request on 20th November 2023 for an extraordinary general meeting of the Royal College of Physicians to debate and revalaute the role of PAs after it was discovered that PAs had been misleading colleagues and patients about their role, thousands of illegal prescriptions had been written, and mass amounts of ionising radiation requests had been made against the law. The EGM was supposed to happen within 8 weeks as per the rules of the Royal College however it actually occurred on 13th March 2025, conveniently after a parliamentary debate scheduled on 17th January 2024. In attendance Professor Steven Powis , National Medical Director, who has no elected role in the RCP, was offered the opportunity to answer questions directly by the chair, then president Dr Sarah Clarke who had to subsequently resign in disgrace . It has since come out that NHS England national leaders coordinated a series of communications and press releases around the delayed RCP events in order to influence the debate abusing their positions of power rather than their equal positions as Fellows of the Royal College. Most egregiously though was the presentation of the survey data that was so misrepresented and skewed that it lead to the resignation of the registrar . For those of you who want to see the EGM, it was recorded and posted on youtube here . If you do choose to watch it, ask yourself is this the toxic debate that is being painted? 6. Physician Associates: A Symptom of a Larger Workforce Problem The introduction of PAs into the NHS could have been a boon if done thoughtfully. There’s undoubtedly a role for physician associates to complement medical teams, helping with tasks that free up doctors for more complex work. Indeed both the BMA and the RCP have published scopes of practice that doctors are asking for help with. Instead, we’re seeing trust after trust recruiting PAs to plug the gaps in rotas whilst simultaneously NHSE Leadership say \"PAs are not a substitute for doctors\" . NHS England leadership has got itself wrapped up in its own lies saying one thing but demonstrably doing another. When the leadership lie like this and can't be honest about issues, solutions, and strategies, they will never ever be able to deliver positive outcomes. A policy that can't stand up to scrutiny and has to be obscured by lies is not a policy worth having. But it's not just the NHSE leadership, it's also the previous DHSC advisor to Jeremy Hunt, now CEO of the GMC, Charlie Massey who is in a tangle. Originally the GMC said it would be for the Royal Colleges to set scope but then once they had, they backtracked over concerns that PAs wouldn't be employed . The regulator of course not being an employer but an institution that should be upholding standards. It is difficult to conclude anything else but that the regulator has been captured by political and institutional interests in pursuing the PA agenda. The answer is depressingly simple. Doctors have been leaving the NHS in droves, driven away by burnout, inadequate pay progression, punishing working conditions, and a training structure that’s chaotic and lacking in continuity. Rather than honestly confronting these failings, NHSE’s leadership has decided it’s simpler and cheaper to introduce a new cadre of staff in direct conflict with doctors' roles. Again, from the vantage point of a spreadsheet, you can see how it might look like a smart solution. But from the vantage point of a ward, it’s a short-sighted fix that could jeopardise patient safety and further demoralise doctors who see their roles being devalued. 7. Where Does Responsibility Lie? In many respects, the Government is ultimately accountable for setting budgets, national policy, and legislation around healthcare. So there’s no denying that the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care and the Treasury have crucial roles to play. However, NHSE’s leadership doesn’t get to shirk its share of the blame. They are the ones tasked with executing policy, drafting the frameworks for trusts to follow, and implementing changes to contracts, rotas, and workforce planning. When doctors complain en masse about unsafe staffing or the decimation of continuity of care, the leadership could – if they had the will – use their influence to advocate for meaningful reforms. Afterall, any effective policy needs buy-in from the people on the ground who will be the ones implementing and delivering it. Unfortunately, we’ve seen time and again how NHSE’s leadership has either stayed silent or offered only cosmetic tweaks. Consider the following: Continued rota gaps : Instead of genuinely negotiating the working patterns in the 2016 contract to ensure safer staffing, NHSE imposed the contract and allowed many trusts to rely on goodwill from exhausted staff and forcibly stab them in the back denying doctors leave for life changing events like weddings or even exams necessary for career progression. Inadequate teaching support : They issue edicts about needing more “in-situ simulation” and “interprofessional learning,” yet do little to ease the service pressures that crowd out teaching time. Deflection on strikes : NHSE leaders could have taken the lead in addressing staff concerns at an early stage, potentially averting strike action. Instead, they focus on public messaging that frames staff as obstructive. Multiple times the Government refused to come to the negotiation table and yet NHS leaders kept blaming both sides . Neglecting structural issues : From the disjointed rotation system to the glaring lack of standardisation across trusts, these are the sorts of large-scale organisational problems that national leadership could work to standardise or improve. But we continue to languish under disparate policies that cause daily inefficiencies. 8. The Human Cost It’s important to remember that these leadership decisions have a very real human cost. When continuity of care breaks down, patients suffer. They might have to retell their stories multiple times, or experience delays in investigations. Sometimes, an important piece of information about their past medical history or social circumstances might not get passed along properly. For doctors, the impact is just as profound. Our training suffers when ward-based clinical teaching is repeatedly cancelled or consultants don't feel invested in training resident doctors because they'll move on shortly. Our morale takes a hit when we’re constantly rotating, never staying long enough to form lasting relationships with our colleagues, or to see the fruits of our work with patients through to the end. Burnout escalates when the system feels more like an assembly line than a place of compassion and learning. I’ve seen colleagues break down in tears at the end of gruelling shifts, convinced they’re failing because no one actually cares about them. They feel completely isolated, undervalued, and the system is designed to literally replace them in a matter of months all while they're dealing with death and life changing illnesses for the patients they care for. I’ve witnessed promising resident doctors question whether they should continue in the NHS at all, or pursue a career abroad where their labour is valued and their training supported. Each time someone hands in their notice or takes a break from training, it’s a small but significant crack in the foundation of our health service. 9. What Needs to Happen If we genuinely want to address the problems in the NHS, we need to look squarely at the decisions coming from inside and at the top of NHS England itself. Here are a few suggestions that have been floated time and again by frontline staff and professional bodies, but have yet to be seriously tackled: Revisit the 2016 Contract : Evaluate whether the purported benefits of spreading doctors more thinly have truly materialised. If they haven’t – and there’s mounting evidence they haven’t – revert or modify the contract to allow for better continuity of care. Protect Ward-Based Teaching : Mandate and enforce policies that guarantee ring-fenced time for clinically focused teaching. Rebuild the team philosophy so that doctors are cared for by other staff. This must be recognised as service provision and an investment in more confident and competent staff who will be more proficient at treating patients in the future. Improve Rotational Structures : Whilst rotating can provide some value, it shouldn’t be so frequent or so poorly planned that it undermines team cohesion and patient care. Standardise certain protocols across trusts to minimise the chaos of adjusting to new systems every few months. Finally bring in this fabled NHS passport that captures mandatory learning on which colour fire extinguisher should be used. Address Workforce Retention : Instead of relying on quick fixes like PAs to fill gaps, double down on retaining qualified doctors by actually teaching them, increase the number of training posts and jobs available for career progression, competitive remuneration, and genuine psychological support from the consultants that they work with that goes beyond a token “resilience” workshop provided by some HR manager you'll never see again. Clarify the Role of Physician Associates : If PAs are to be integrated into the NHS, they must have a well-defined scope of practice and adequate supervision. They should supplement, not replace, doctors. Listen to the doctors and use the BMA and RCP documents which are what are asking for help with. Transparency and Accountability : NHSE leaders need to be transparent about the impact of their policies and be willing to share data openly. They should invite scrutiny of outcomes, rather than hiding behind carefully curated public statements that gloss over systemic failures. The public also need to take an interest in the individuals who are actually driving and implementing the policies that are leading to the failure of the NHS rather than solely blaming politicians. 10. Looking Ahead We’re at a crossroads for the NHS. As each year goes by, the pressures intensify, more staff leave, and public satisfaction declines. The blame game becomes more fraught, and those in senior leadership sometimes appear more invested in protecting their reputations than in rectifying the root causes of these problems. Reforming the culture requires the right people with the right incentives and disincentives in the right place and we don't have any of those things because the leadership either doesn't have the political courage to be honest and be scrutinised, policy expertise to create a more productive framework, or operational abilities to deliver the kind of compassionate environment they apparently desire. Yet, the NHS still has an extraordinary, dedicated workforce. Resident doctors, consultants, nurses, allied health professionals, support staff, and managers on the ground care deeply about their patients and about delivering high-quality care. They’ve proven this time and again, braving pandemics, winter pressures, and political upheavals. What they need, and what patients deserve, is senior leadership that has the courage to admit mistakes, reverse damaging policies, and engage honestly with those on the front lines to give them the tools they need. If we want an NHS that’s fit for the next 75 years, we need to confront the elephant in the room: the senior leadership in NHSE must be held to account for decisions that have fundamentally altered the structure of medical work, eroded continuity of care, and diminished the training environment. We can’t keep plastering over the cracks and blaming crises on predictable demand, pretend that introducing physician associates will magically fill the void left by experienced doctor, nor giving the NHS more money when there are clear and obvious reforms that can improve working conditions and productivity. True leadership isn’t about writing an article defending your chosen policies or issuing press releases in lockstep using contradictory terms like \"dependent... but can also work independently\" when the national conversation turns inconvenient. It’s about listening to feedback from the trenches, taking responsibility for missteps, and fighting for the resources and policy changes that will sustain both staff wellbeing and patient outcomes in the long run. Final Thoughts I know a rant on Reddit might not change the world overnight, but all too often conversations about the NHS boil down to \"it needs more money\" or \"it's a black hole for money\" or \"privatisation\" or \"too many managers\". I hope this post can spark a more specific conversation about some specific examples of the kinds of things that are going wrong and some solutions that could help as well as highlighting some of the irritating and frustrating circular logic that managers use. Many of us genuinely want to stay in the NHS and make it work. We believe in the principles of a healthcare system free at the point of need. But unless those at the top start owning up to their role in the slow-motion collapse we’re witnessing, it’s hard to be optimistic. If you’re reading this and you’re part of that senior leadership, I challenge you to set aside the spin and politics, to step out onto the wards and clinics more regularly, and to speak with staff at every level. Hear what they’re saying about rotas, continuity of care, training, and workforce gaps. Acknowledge how poorly some of these initiatives – especially the 2016 contract changes – have served patients and staff. Re-read The Tooke Report and \"The Role of The Doctor\" - most of us agree with that definition so equip us with the tools, actually build strong teams that stay and grow together in the spirit of excellence, and reap the dividends of a happy workforce. Then, and only then, can we begin to rebuild a system that actually lives up to the ideals upon which the NHS was founded. Until that day comes, we’ll keep calling out the problems and hoping that, somewhere in the corridors of NHSE’s headquarters, someone is listening and willing to do something different. Because if we allow the current trajectory to continue, we risk losing the heart of the NHS altogether: the dedication and expertise of those who work within it, and the trust of those who depend upon its care.

Although the level of interest seems to be down compared to Februrary 2024 we still got a good amount of feedback. The closest thing we had to a huge breakout coming completely out of nowhere (similar to eden's guardian and mendacium) has been Sealed Bite which got a very positive reception. Conversely, the two biggest disappointments are Ceplion and Light of the Darkness which got a somewhat negative reception. Bo got the most positive reception while STEAM TRIGGER got the worst reception. I myself have played Caravan SandWitch (not a metroidvania afterall) and Witchroid Vania. All the games are sorted by order of public reception, from best reception to worst reception. Extremely positive reception Bo: Path of the Teal Lotus - coming 17 July 2024 : A very highly anticipated celestoidvania inspired by japanese mythology. The demo has gotten a rave reception with a promise that fans of metroidvanias like aeterna noctis will enjoy it. There are almost no complaints to speak of, the tiny few have already been addressed by the devs. The developer is u/Feverishcs BLADE CHIMERA - coming in 2024 : The latest team ladybug metroidvania project under development. It is inspired by SOTN similarly to their previous project deedlit in wonderland but it takes inpiration in its own way with a familiar sword that transforms into the things you need for the situation at hand and gunfire mechanics. Featuring the usual buttery smooth gameplay that these devs have become famous for, there is almost no negative feedback to speak of other than preferences regarding the character's movement speed and reload function. Exographer : A gorgeous 16 bit science-based metroidvania developed by a member of this community. Has no combat with a focus on animal well style puzzles and some movement ability upgrades. The demo was very polished and got a really warm reception. The developer is u/lenanena Generally positive reception Lone Fungus 2 : A 16 bit metroidvania developed by a member of this community, sequel to the famous lone fungus! Players have described this as an improved Lone Fungus, with a focus on castlevania style gameplay over precision platforming in comparison to the previous game. This has gotten an rave reception due to being the first indie metroidvania project to take inspiration from the QoL features that PoP the lost crown pioneered. The game has gotten complaints about the behaviour of the camera however, with some reporting it gave them motion sickness. the developer is u/professorbasti Delearnia: Fractions of Hope - coming 8 August 2024 : An educational metroidvania where you use math to overcome obstacles. Functionally, the game is a puzzle platforming focused metroidvania similar to ColorBlend FX Desaturation. The demo has gotten a generally positive reception, but for it potentials as an educational browser based game for young children moreso than as a metroidvania. The developer is u/DjBANGOOO Yars Rising - coming in 2024 : A neon sci-fi futuristic metroidvania under development by the devs of Shantae and the mummy demastered. According to players, this has the highest production value out of all of the demos of the steam next fest and it features voice acting, crisp 2.5D graphics and well made music. A few have complained about the controls, the hacking minigame, and the excessive dialogue. Sealed Bite: Extended - coming in 2024 : A 16 bit metroidvania with a lot of love put into it. This is the closest thing we have this time around to a hugely successful demo coming completely out of nowhere. The game has gotten a very positive reception on account of its artwork that has a remarkable amount of love put into it as well as its unique combat mechanics. Complaints are minor but include insta-kill mechanics + insufficient checkpoints, the attack being finicky, and the font being inconsistent with the graphics of the game. Voidwrought - coming in 2024 : A gorgeous hand drawn metroidvania that has graphics similar to hollow knight but it plays like symphony of the night and doesn't feature a corpse run. The game has gotten praise for its artwork and music. Players report it being a little rough around the edges especially with the hotboxes, and the movement. The strange design of having two types of dash also got some criticism for being unintuitive. Stardust Demon - coming in 2024 : An 8 bit colorful metroidvania. It seems to be getting a lukewarm reception. The gameplay is reportedly good and the game is overall similar to spyro, megaman, and metroid. The game has been praised for its unique platforming elements and its good controls. However, there have been several complaints about the running and jumping being too slow, feeling like you're underwater or playing in slow motion. Mixed reception Before I go : A difficult 2.5 metroid-like with a theme of life and death. It has received strong praise for its graphics and controls. The game has quite a few similarities with GRIME in its themes and graphics but not its gameplay which is comparable to metroid instead. Complaints involve the world feeling too samey, exploration not feeling rewarding, the world feeling empty and purposeless, the existence of a death penalty despite the tough platforming challenges, and it being sometimes difficult to properly see what's happening on the screen. The developer seems to have taken note of most of these complaints. The developer is u/jslabratory Mira and the legend of the Djinns - coming in Q3 2024 : A 16 bit moroccan metroidvania. It appears to have gotten a mixed reception with people complaining about the grammar, the map which doesnt even show your position on it, the lack of visible damage for things that can be damaged, and the excessive use of gaundlet rooms. There was also a lot of critisism for the lack of keyboard settings or rebind settings. Praise was given for the combat, the movement, the environments, and the artwork. The developer is u/Hyblitz Slug Gear : 16 bit chibi metroidvania. This is getting a mixed reception with people praising the graphics, the main menu, the UI and the equip system but critisizing the limited map, the rough edges, the useless collectibles, the bland boss, and the need to stand still when attacking... This has no major issues though but at the same time has nothing that makes it really stand out. Iron diamond : - coming 26 July 2024 : A brightly colored metroidvania made by a humble developer. The demo has gotten a mixed reception with people liking the controls and gameplay while critisizing the graphics, the audio, and especially the animations which are all too much like a free flash game. the public reception towards this seems to be almost identical to slug gear. The developer is u/FrickinSilly . Witchroid Vania: A magical girl's fantastical adventures - coming in 2024 : A japanese 16 bit spell-based igavania. It appears to have gotten a mixed reception with people praising the smooth performance and the rewarding gameplay while critisizing the map as well as some mechanics such as ledge climbing among other things. There's a lot of rough edges here but the potential is great Arcana Dimension - coming in 2025 : An asian metroidvania with character switching and JRPG elements. This one is getting praise for its gameplay while being critisized for its graphics, map, and the way the character swap currently works. Generally negative reception 5 Star Fishy - coming in 2026 : A unique budgetvania that is expected to release in 2026. It has been praised for its originality but has gotten a mildly negative reception due to its extremely bad graphics, its rough edges, its unclear UI, MS paint map, and excessively fast character speed. Ceplion : A rather beautiful 16 bit metroidvania with a lot of RPG elements. Reception seems somewhat negative with praise for the controls except the grappling hook. Currently has no map, it is not known if the final release will have a map. Some people are reporting severe performance issues. The game is surprisingly very parry reliant and there are UI complaints and a lack of consistency with environmental hazards. The developer of Ceplion is u/KedyDev The light of the darkness: Origins : This is a soulslike metroidvania that has been under development since forever. It features themes of light vs darkness similar to aeterna noctis and features flight as a core mechanic. Unfortunately the demo has gotten a negative reception with several small problems all combining to create a very bad experience. The only positive comments involve the flight. The developer is u/Sephius The elderseed : While this is a metroidvania, it has gotten a negative reception. the reason for this is because the game is severly unpolished and the controls are poor. Furthermore, there are a lot of bugs as well. The graphics are also somewhat poor. The sacred acorn - coming 17 July 2024 : This topdown soulslike metroidvania has gotten a negative reception with nearly everyone panning it for a myriad of problems. It is still not completely certain if this is a metroidvania as no one was able to get far enough and find out before getting frustrated with the game's problems. Quest of Dungeloria : A parody medieval metroidvania. The demo is unfortunately a disaster with tons of problems including multiple crashes. Extremely negative reception STEAM TRIGGER : A 2.5D steampunk metroidvania that is expected to enter early access this year. Unfortunately, the demo is a complete disaster with nothing but extremely negative comments for it. This seems to be what rubro rose's castle was for the februrary steam next fest: an utterly useless pile of worthless putrid garbage that exists solely to waste the lifespan of your SSD.

I'm not talking about the issues people always bring up, I mean the really small and petty complaints. My big 2 are: Arus should have been named Sauros after grandpa Sauros. I know that grandpa sauros was discredited but since Ariel is queen i imagine the story was set straight. Grandpa Sauros and rudeus were eris 2 most important people, since sauros died it makes sense she'd name her kid after him but instead it's after some mythological hero. It will probably be covered in redundant reincarnation at some point, but imo Soldat should have had a happy ending confirmed. The last I know of him he said to Rudeus that when he loses an arm and has to quit adventuring to give him a job. Also why couldn't have he gone to Sylphie's wedding reception? I guess it would be awkward for elinalise especially considering her breakdown she has, but he was in Sharia and just couldn't go which annoyed me, he could have atleast had some funny interaction with Sylphy saying \"it's you who managed to cure quagmire ay?\" Or something. I just think he was underutilised and forgotten as the story progressed. After all he saved Rudeus at one of his lowest points.

The author has already said that he planned to make this a short series with Rudeus becoming overpowered like a standard isekai, but he changed his mind because of the good reception of Roxy's chapter and decided that the series would be longer. Because of this, he stopped increasing Rudeus's magic skills until volume 18. There were many better ways to nerf Rudeus, such as increasing the enemies' power scale or instead of Rudeus winning with brute destruction like in the series, the action scenes would be much better if he used different spells to do tricks and defeat his enemies with cunning, in the style of the God of the North. Besides that, I don't like how the fights last so little, I wish they had better writing so I could enjoy them more.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/mushokutensei/comments/1lf8kwk/comment/mymc59s/","user_commenting":"Ambitious_Bar_8786","user_url":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ambitious_Bar_8786/","date_of_comment":null,"num_upvotes":4,"num_replies":0,"replies":[]}],"community_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/mushokutensei/","community_description":"A landing page for the Japanese light novel and web novel named Mushoku Tensei.","community_members_num":89035,"community_rank":{"community_rank_type":null,"community_rank_value":null},"post_karma":0,"bio_description":null,"embedded_links":null,"timestamp":"2025-07-26T23:18:32.524Z","input":{"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/mushokutensei/comments/1lf8kwk/petty_complaints_problems_with_the_series/"},"discovery_input":{"keyword":"Devpost complaints problems issues","date":"Past year","num_of_posts":50,"sort_by":"Relevance"}},{"post_id":"t3_1hk2w88","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/helldivers2/comments/1hk2w88/frv_complaints_skill_issues/","user_posted":"Toombu","title":"FRV complaints = Skill issues","description":"Seriously, it's not bad. I've seen this come up in quite a few comments, and I agree with it that it drives pretty realistically, especially for a beefy military vehicle. Sorry it doesn't have arcade style handling, but are you really surprised you can't drive flat out over bumps and dunes without problems? Keyboard and mouse can definitely make it harder to drive, so plug in a $15 ocean gate special logitech controller and pick it up when you get in the car. Take it easy over the bumps, and you'll be fine. You'll still outrun everything. Personally, I'll be really disappointed if AH listens to the complaints about it being too difficult to drive. I think that's half the fun of it. It's actually a pretty true physics model, and it's a ton of fun. If you are having a hard time driving, literally just drive slower until you get the hang of it. Edit: For people saying it is slipperier than a real car, you gotta put it in perspective. This is a vehicle that can be shot in the tires and not immediately lose tire pressure. It's a car that can have an explosion go off nearby, get attacked by large animals (bugs), and drive over small fires without damage. I agree that if you compare it to something like a Polaris or Can-Am UTV, it has shit performance, but this is more like a stripped-down humvee. It is perfectly reasonable that it has a high CG and tires that are much less soft/sticky than you'd expect on an offroad race car.

Mastering a class there and have ez street on very Op, would take already a lot of time. Then there is the Multiplayer mode, which is a different beast and also comes with all its unlockable stuff. In those 6 months we also got like two extra Ops for free to play, and we know that \"Horde mode\" aka \"Last Stand\" will come this year to keep us further spill blood. I can accept that after 60h put into the campaign and various playmodes you might feel like you seen it all. And maybe one of your Op classes is already maxed and you might have beaten the toughest difficulty every where, but the game is pretty young. If you expect here some sandbox replay ability with thousands of hours to waste like in a MMO, or some 10 year old game with at least 10 DLCs under its belt, then the problem is on your side.","date_of_reply":"2025-03-03T10:06:49.765Z","num_replies":0,"num_upvotes":5}]},{"comment":"There are so many different types of gamers these days trying to keep them all happy is just not possible.

Also..SH is determined by the standard set by the accuser. Thats going to be an issue for her team","description":"First bit: In notgoldens videos she was discussing how she'd noticed potential exposure for JB if there was no investigation after any report of SH (even if the person did not want to file an official complaint, idk much about this just what I've heard/understood). Sony and SAG both will redirect as per policy to the producers - her issue is that wayfair is run by the same people she wants to complain about. Without going into why not file something official since you've allegedly brought it up to them in the end anyways (although... Seriously why not... Because the threat achieved what it was supposed to?) here's a real problem for her... ... If other actors came to her with complaints of SH, as EXECUTIVE PRODUCER she may actually be liable for the same thing she's trying to accuse JB of. In the hierarchy of how complaints get handled, executive producer is at the top of the list. If she was told, and then chose not to conduct an investigation or even file an official complaint on their behalf even when offered the opportunity to, that's failure to comply with the same rules/laws she's says JB broke. We obviously don't have any docs on what exactly the nature/format/context of the complaint discussion she had with JB was like (since she's basically jigsaw puzzled quotes from day 1), BUT she herself has now stated that she received multiple complaints from these actors. Sure you can say everything she did in the beginning was in order to protect them (we will need dates on that evidence though, thank you) but if JB's 'informal' response wasn't enough because there was a lack of 3rd party investigation, then her lack of investigation through a 3rd party is absolutely also legitimate. Especially since she's the one who's directly claiming she heard those complaints. Second part: So again in notgoldens videos she discusses how SH has to meet subjective and objective criteria, however the criteria can be met simply by how the person \"felt\". If a claim of \"I felt uncomfortable here here and here\" is stated, BUT she also uses similar language outside of her acting role (please reference teeth, yummy, xxx etc), then she's effectively lowered the bar to the ground in terms of language that she can now turn around and say made her uncomfortable. It's different from her claims of she can use sexy to describe the character, but he (allegedly) used it outside of that role, because these other terms were clearly between the two of them speaking as BL and JB. She sets the standard as the accuser for what type of language makes her \"feel\" uncomfortable, and that's going to actually be held as the bar in her own case. Bar meet floor. Edit: copy paste of part of my comment from below on the clarification of producer title/role/responsibility plus the catch-22 situation: I think I'd just read that she was initially executive producer (could claim it's a vanity title but then would have to explain stepping outside that scope from the beginning when she says she wasn't seeking creative control), then producer, then the PGA mark (which plays more into the extortion side of the suit). Someone who's actually on the legal teams will have to argue the scope of power in all of these titles as she held & understood them during different phases of her claims. I find that she's sort of locked herself into this messy catch-22 situation. If she says she didn't hold any power as an executive producer then she opens herself up to questioning about all the pushback on wanting to write scenes, wardrobe etc. which implies \"seeking\" additional power/creative control during the 17 List. I she says she was eligible as per her employment to have these protections and investigations applied then she gets asked why is the contract not signed? If she says that it was an implied contract (or whatever, my own made up term) the question about using it for extortion of power/creative control comes up again. If she says the implied contract gave her the implied and unspecified right to creative input by action/verbal agreement from Baldoni which was later changed (ie retaliation claim bit), then those very same implications push the title outside the scope of vanity title and make her potentially liable for the responsibility to address SH claims as a producer would. There are many ways to attack her claims because the narrative doesn't hold up against so many avenues of counter claims.

While an interesting thought exercise, I assure you, there is nothing here. There's a lot of misunderstandings here, some of the main ones: You're confusing roles of executive producer (role) vs. producer (role) vs. production company and employer. Wayfarer or It ends with Us LLC was the production company here and was the employer. The employer is responsible for ensuring a safe work environment. That is not to say a person hired as a Producer (job) by the production company (employer) is allowed to SH someone, but the employee makes complaints to the company. There are no other lawsuits that have been brought here. If there were, Baldoni/Wayfarer certainly wouldn't be the one to bring them in this lawsuit. It would have to be brought by the hypothetical aggrieved parties. Freedman could not act for those parties given the obvious conflicts here. You are misunderstanding what subjective/objective criteria means. It means that the behaviour alleged to be harassment must have been behaviour that was both: (a) inappropriate from Lively's perspective (subjective); and (b) behaviour that the reasonable person would consider inappropriate in the circumstances (objective). People, I promise you that no matter how invested you are in this case, you do not comprehend the legal issues better than the trained and experienced lawyers that are being paid real money to work on this case.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ItEndsWithLawsuits/comments/1itzzz8/comment/mdwi41t/","user_commenting":"Aggressive_Today_492","user_url":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Aggressive_Today_492/","date_of_comment":null,"num_upvotes":3,"num_replies":2,"replies":[{"user_replying":"Jellygator0","user_url":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Jellygator0/","reply":"Also, add on, I did try to clarify my thought process on the roles in an edit above. What are your thoughts about her not lodging a complaint with wayfair because the CEO and COO were the people she was complaining about? Wayfair LLC is the entity that would receive the HR complaint, and whether it's CEO or COO being the subject of the complaint shouldn't nullify the responsibilities it would have after receiving it (and if it did then that's a slam dunk case for her). However, by not lodging the HR complaint as set out in SAG, reservations or not, does that not give them a way out because there's nothing there to action/investigate? She didn't have to give it to JB or Heath, but she was told by Sony that she needs to give it to wayfair and she's said that she doesn't want to do anything official. Wouldn't that absolve them of doing anything official as well like the investigations etc?

In fact the overwhelming majority of the 17 points are solely in relation to Blake aside from a requirement that there be no hugging of her on set personnel or her employees. Given her complaint provides that this document was crafted to ensure cast and crew had adequate protections moving forward, it’s quite striking that the 17 point document pretty much only relates to herself","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ItEndsWithLawsuits/comments/1itzzz8/comment/mdvbgq3/","user_commenting":"karsullo","user_url":"https://www.reddit.com/user/karsullo/","date_of_comment":null,"num_upvotes":6,"num_replies":0,"replies":[]},{"comment":"I’m a lawyer and I posted this on another thread…but I definitely think this could turn into a problem for her: Yes, pretty much every employer (and union in this case) is going to have a mechanism for reporting sexual harassment that is published to employees. The reason everyone has this is because there was a Supreme Court case about 20 years ago that set up a “safe harbor” for employers in sexual harassment cases. If an employer has a reporting mechanism set up, and the alleged victim does not use that reporting mechanism, then they can’t turn around and hold the employer responsible later.

This is not a Dune Hate Post.","description":"My guild has had sandcrawler parts disappear from inventory when traveling to or from DD. Other items have also disappeared from vehicle and individual character inventories. I saw something from Funcom about being aware of part of this problem though they seemed to discount it as serious from their wording. I am in a guild and some of the guild's leadership are on the verge of quitting. They are currently off playing another game while waiting for a fix from the Dune devs. They are also quoting complaints from others about people getting stuck in the DD, and pve area bases being pvped. They do not want to spend time building or working on anything if its going to be lost. My problem is that once people begin to go off playing another game that's usually the end. I hear constant negativity from them now. I love Dune and haven't even seen the problems some of them cite but I believe them. I wish Funcom was more open and proactive about letting people know that they hear the concerns and are concerned to. I think they should be talking to the Dune gamers daily about their desire to help and fix things. I fear they may lose this game if they do not do something. Hire more people to address bugs/cheats/exploits--more people to do damage control on player's perceptions of their fixing the game and the issues? I had hoped the latest corelis storm would have come with at least a hit fix for what I have named. I wonder if Funcom might consider taking the game completely offline for like 12 hours to fix stuff.

Just several numerous loud voices are distorted to the point of being like static.the volume levels are over the place. It's like there was no edit in post. No compression, limiting or mastering here..Maybe some audio engineering interns set up recording booths with improper mics, and not a sense of distance or insulation or recording techniques, then pressed play on the ost on their Bluetooth speaker and recorded it together on the microphone of their iPhone 14.

I know most people say second episode was OK, but hear me out, we cannot let this go just as another ok anime, why? Because this will keep being a trend if we let it happen! The studio and everyone involved had 5 years to do something that was on the level of the 1 ep, it's not like the anime was rushed or that the studio had to overwork the animator to do this (considering Uzumaki will only be 4 episodes and comparing this second episode to other animes that were 26 eps and coming out weekly), we need to show that this is not ok, would you be ok if this keeps happening over and over again? I don't think so! If we let this slip by as just another meh anime, this will keep happening, more so when they had 5 YEARS to make it happen and only 4 episodes, it feels like they are just spiting right into our faces, expecting this to be just a mid anime and have a quick buck...","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/horror/comments/1fz33r6/comment/lrve0vq/","user_commenting":"henflo99","user_url":"https://www.reddit.com/user/henflo99/","date_of_comment":"2024-10-14T13:19:38.183Z","num_upvotes":1,"num_replies":0,"replies":[]},{"comment":"im an anime only watcher and haven't read the manga yet but its kinda enjoyable am i crazy lol?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/horror/comments/1fz33r6/comment/lrqmlnr/","user_commenting":"z6giselle","user_url":"https://www.reddit.com/user/z6giselle/","date_of_comment":"2024-10-13T16:24:08.779Z","num_upvotes":1,"num_replies":0,"replies":[]},{"comment":"Im like hoping they will fix it in post like tori animation did with sailor moon crystal","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/horror/comments/1fz33r6/comment/lr9g0me/","user_commenting":"ThisWalrusisWhole","user_url":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ThisWalrusisWhole/","date_of_comment":"2024-10-10T15:09:13.956Z","num_upvotes":1,"num_replies":0,"replies":[]},{"comment":"Maybe somebody could run it through an AI animator and “fix it”?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/horror/comments/1fz33r6/comment/lr6s1jd/","user_commenting":"[deleted]","user_url":"https://www.reddit.com/svc/shreddit/comments/r/horror/undefined","date_of_comment":"2024-10-10T01:42:14.646Z","num_upvotes":1,"num_replies":0,"replies":[]},{"comment":"Is everybody mad about the animation?

We had a younger employee file a racial discrimination complaint against her primary manager recently. After a full investigation, we weren't able to corroborate any of the issues raised in the complaint. In fact, we actually found that the complainant herself was exhibiting some pretty strong discrimination herself against her manager. The complaint(s) raised focused around how feedback was given and is akin more to conflict in managerial style preferences than anything. Long story short, we found the employee had no problem receiving identical feedback (down to the language used) from other indirect-managers, but because her manager was a certain class that seems to be the issue. Anyways, we reported the findings back to all relevant parties, warned everyone of consequences for retaliation, etc and considered the matter closed. Or so we thought. Since then, we have noticed the employee is meeting privately with other like-classed employees who she would otherwise have no business dealing with. We chalked it up to \"well, we can't tell people who to hang out with,\" until one of them came to HR saying that this person was trying to stir the pot, accusing the company of things that clearly weren't true. I'm curious to hear other HR reps' stories about similar situations and how they ended up.","num_comments":30,"date_posted":"2025-04-27T20:38:08.775Z","community_name":"humanresources","num_upvotes":45,"photos":null,"videos":null,"tag":"Employee Relations","related_posts":[{"community":"eeoc","community_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/EEOC/comments/1m622ir/discrimination_complaint/","title":"DISCRIMINATION COMPLAINT","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/EEOC/comments/1m622ir/discrimination_complaint/","thumbnail":null,"num_upvotes":"7","num_comments":46},{"community":"humanresources","community_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/humanresources/comments/1kz3ebp/is_this_an_overreach_pa/","title":"Is this an overreach [PA]","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/humanresources/comments/1kz3ebp/is_this_an_overreach_pa/","thumbnail":null,"num_upvotes":"46","num_comments":32},{"community":"legaladvicecanada","community_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvicecanada/comments/13kclwh/i_filed_a_complaint_about_my_boss_and_the_hr/","title":"I filed a complaint about my \"boss\", and the HR department told him it was me who complained","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvicecanada/comments/13kclwh/i_filed_a_complaint_about_my_boss_and_the_hr/","thumbnail":null,"num_upvotes":"37","num_comments":63},{"community":"humanresources","community_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/humanresources/comments/lhdl6t/hr_complaint_filed_against_hr_need_advice/","title":"HR complaint filed against HR.

Also your post doesn't tell us if this is a discrimination complaint or a hostile work environment complaint because these would be addressed differently. You say that neither manager nor employee are white however, a black person can be motivated to discriminate against another black person, and can also be motivated to discriminate against a latino person etc. It sounds as if you had a hostile work environment complaint, the complainant did not like the outcome, so she is rallying other with the same protected class to join her in a renewed complaint or a claim with the EEOC. Review your materials to identify whether the target admitted to or was alleged to have said something implicating race (if that's the protected class). E.g. \"you people\" or in some other setting talking about how she felt about or her previous history with the complainant's race, or a comment that was made about race while the manager was engaged in the complained of conduct. Without that, you probably don't have HWE unless you're in the 5th or 6th circuits. Now, if you have someone who has alleged she is trying to coax others to file a bad faith complaint (alleging things that are not true), you should conduct another investigation and if you find the allegations are substantiated, you should fire her.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/humanresources/comments/1k9dvd9/comment/mq9uzkv/","user_commenting":"Hot-District7964","user_url":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Hot-District7964/","date_of_comment":null,"num_upvotes":1,"num_replies":0,"replies":[]},{"comment":"What the employee is doing is protected as employees have a right to complain about pay and working conditions (supervisors) with each other.

You can also advise anyone coming to you saying this is happening that if someone is discussing any topic they don't want to participate in they can walk away or say the conversation is unwanted.

Factually, nothing new has actually happened. The other employee came to HR saying they were stirring the pot. Did that employee make a complaint that is THEIR OWN and not hearsay? You had a complaint. You investigated. You concluded. Employees didn't like the result and is trying to find others who believe there is some systemic issue. If there isn't, unless you have other underlying issues for mass grievances, it could just fizzle out. I've seen it many times, and it's never gone anywhere APART from when it did - and there were some underlying issues the management and CEO continued to ignore. Of course there is some risk here, but aggreived employees will often take this approach and there are little preventative steps you can take here. Eventually they usually got bored that nobody is listening to them.

The recent addition of showing their abilities is great, but give us the option to display their entire loadout. Improve the top-left cash standings on the HUD. I don’t mind doing quick math, but showing our team’s updated cash after deposits or cashing out would be a great addition. The onboarding tutorial for Cashout, while better than it was at launch, still needs a lot of improvement. When my game crashes, don’t load me back to the menu and make me reconnect manually. The game should automatically relaunch into the match. I believe Overwatch does this, if I recall correctly. The recent players screen really needs improvement. Show a list of matches, my teammates, the opponents, and their team colors, etc. The statistics screen also needs major improvements. Give me all the stats! I know you’re tracking them, Embark! Allow me to DM people from anywhere, whether I’m in a match or in the menus. Just copy the whisper system from Battle.net. The friends list screen could also use enhancements. Show more details than just “In menu” or “In game.” Display the round they’re in if they’re in a tournament, or the remaining time if they’re in a match. And don’t show “In menu” just because they’re online on Steam—show it only if they’re actually loaded into the game menu. Maybe add an additional status for “In queue.” Finally, setting a status like “Looking to play [GAMEMODE]” would be awesome, so friends checking the list know if they should invite you. Add text chat on console. Add a post match screen, or game history screen, to let me see my last matches and how I did.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/thefinals/comments/1gr4il4/comment/lx3qjf7/","user_commenting":"58696384896898676493","user_url":"https://www.reddit.com/user/58696384896898676493/","date_of_comment":null,"num_upvotes":3,"num_replies":0,"replies":[]}],"community_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/thefinals/","community_description":"Community for THE FINALS, a free-to-play, team-based, first-person shooter \nthat pushes environmental dynamism, destruction,\n and player freedom to the limits.","community_members_num":168967,"community_rank":{"community_rank_type":null,"community_rank_value":null},"post_karma":0,"bio_description":null,"embedded_links":null,"timestamp":"2025-07-26T23:18:33.267Z","input":{"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/thefinals/comments/1gr4il4/what_uiux_features_or_changes_would_improve_your/"},"discovery_input":{"keyword":"Devpost complaints problems issues","date":"Past year","num_of_posts":50,"sort_by":"Relevance"}},{"post_id":"t3_1kk4v1i","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianWorkplace/comments/1kk4v1i/can_someone_confirm_if_raising_a_complaint_about/","user_posted":"EducationalFan8366","title":"Can someone confirm if raising a complaint about my manager, coworker, or HR will cause problems in BGV?","description":"Can someone confirm if raising a complaint about my manager, coworker, or HR will cause problems in BGV?

Frames are huge compared to normal glasses. Apart from aesthetics, it’ll block your peripheral vision way more than traditional glasses. Location services not working atm, so pics and videos aren’t storing the location. Also AI can’t reply to location based stuff like “nearest x” or the weather. Sound is okay, no bass though. If you’re used to airpods pro or similar, you’ll feel this as a big compromise. For calls and audio messages they’re okay. I though this glasses would allow me to capture moments in a less intrusive way but, for now, the frames are more intrusive to me than pulling my phone. Also low light quality is not as good as I thought. I though I could wear these daily, not so sure anymore. Still thinking about specific use cases for them now that I’ve assumed that.

Also, the rage over rate limits is wild - “I hit 35 messages in an hour and now I’m locked out!” Yes, because you sent 35 \"fix my code\" prompts that all boiled down to \"help, my JavaScript is crying\" with zero context.

This post containes descriptions and screenshots for comparison ('.975 vs. '.987+)","description":"Edit: Off course, all of this could be almost entirely exclusive to my or comparable specs (listed at the bottom). I don't know how necessary this edit is but here you go. First off, I love this game, it's pretty much a game I always wanted. I have well above 200 hrs in the game since launch, it's the only game I played since it came out. Needless to say, I'm very passionate about it, and hope the following things will get a work-over of some sort *pray to basket man* I'm not the only one having issues, I know that much. Here is my OG post about the beta with further references in the comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/ManorLords/comments/1f2fhlw/noticed_a_significant_downgrade_in_visuals_and/ The first of any given set of two slides/pictures is 0.7.975 (from now on \" main \"), the second slide is from the beta-branch (0.7.987 (from now on \" beta \") and I assume the newest current beta-branch that released today/yesterday). Additional stuff as descriptions in the screenshots Most of the points I will make are technical, but there are certain things that are either creative or born out of time constraints or were just not a priority for now. I'm aware that Greg is prob working his ass off and porting this thing to UE5 wasn't easy I assume, but if some of these issues stem from a creative descision rather than any other reason I hope he changes his mind These screenshots were taken with the exact same graphic settings (ultra everything, 4 k, FSR performance mode). Set 1: looks stunning and clear, lush green everything is milky and muddy, quite ugly Set 2: draw distance great draw distance really not great Set 3: Nice and crisp, grass looks natural Muddy and milky, colors are off/worse IMO (yes further away but even the the trees that are in the same distance as in the first pic look muddy) Set 4: apart from the rain, the green of the trees again looks off and worse IMO Now, with performance mode in beta, I would get at least somewhat okay-ish FPS, but as soon as I switched to \"balanced\", the FPS got annihilated and it still looked worse than main with performance mode. Apart from the graphical issues one can make out when watching at a screenshot, the game is very unpleasantly \"noisy\", none of the AA methods would work as they did before, nothing is smooth, it's quite a sore for the eyes. I think the only positve are the shadows (sharper), but even when I selected the one setting below highest for shadows, it ran as bad/bad and certainly still worse than main. Newest drivers were installed. Tried the performance mode in the AMD Adrenaline Software app thing, to no avail.

The contrast shouldnt have changed, I disabled a layer of fog so I would expect it to increase. It ML it was always dependent on the viewing angle cause shadows were too dark in some situations otherwise. So I think you just maybe nitpicked a shot? The LOD distances also shouldnt have changed, some data got scrapped when upgrading and we try to replicate it and keep the performance as high as possible. Is this only the tree impostors or something else? The grass was reworked cause players said its too brownish and muddy. So I made it greener and more contrasty. There were positive comments so I left it like that. Overall ue5 upgrade was kinda forced on me and it was a ton of hard work and bugs and frustrations and not only that, some players say it looks worse. Some say it looks much better, or much sharper. In our more scientific tests, the fps has increased and stabilized. I think I may lose my mind at some point. Edit: I forgot to be polite. I appreciate that you enjoy the game very much, and take the time to write honest feedback. I will analyse your feedback deeper tomorrow and try to improve. Edit2: I analysed the feedback as promised by doing more back and forths between UE4 and UE5. I noticed that the described \"mushiness\" is the lack of fog inscattering texture which didn't work as well in UE5 since the clouds were replaced with the new cloud system, which then made the fog more \"even\" while earlier it had handpainted \"spots\" where it was weaker or stronger. Furthermore I did notice that the tree LODs look more aggressive - it wasn't our intention, some of the settings just got borked in the upgrade process for some reason and had to be retuned. The max shadow resolution for \"soft\" (cascade) was lowered back to default cause I expected users to pick \"sharp\" (VSM) which ignores this, I brought it back. Previously in UE4 it was overclocked a bit. I also noticed I made the trees brighter cause some players insisted that spring trees are bright and that game is unrealistic. I will now darken them back again as you ask.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ManorLords/comments/1fa01t7/comment/llvdn3u/","user_commenting":"gstyczen","user_url":"https://www.reddit.com/user/gstyczen/","date_of_comment":null,"num_upvotes":1,"num_replies":0,"replies":[]},{"comment":"Ngl I didn’t even notice a difference ?

The first vet he saw was lovely and understanding he may be scared when he had the first jab, she petted him and rewarded him with treats. Today, we had a new lady, she didn't seem all too interested in petting him or making him feel comfortable. He's quite shy anyway around new people. She didn't offer any treats for him for behaving and holding still. He lightly bit her and we said we think he is scared. She took him away from us into a separate room to inert his microchip which I knew he wouldn't like.. Anyway she returns, a cloth / towel over his face and body and was basically in tears saying he didn't like it (which we knew because we heard him cry) and proceeded to tell us it's completely unacceptable for him to be biting anyone in the nastiest tone of voice I have ever heard. I have lived with cats in my childhood/ life and understand cats can become aggressive when distressed. She told us we need to see a behavioural therapist for this. She was quite badly scratched on her arm and as I said she was basically crying, which did make me feel bad. We apologised for him hurting her but she didn't seem to care about our apology. I don't know, I got the feeling she didn't like cats from the get go but now I'm doubting my fur baby.. ? He isn't agressive with us. He sometimes gently hites us when playing but has never really hurt us. Do we need to address this issue with him or is this normal reaction for a 13 week old cat getting needles and all sorts done?? Part of me dislikes the vet for her attitude but equally want to make sure we dont have an issue on our hands. Opinions / advice? UPDATE Contacted the practice who politely advised that in fact, she wasn't a vet, she was a nurse and in fact, NONE of them work there permanently!? So no guarantee of seeing that first lady ever again. I am so upset about this all, I have made a complaint and will be taking my baby elsewhere in future. Thank you for your kind words and suggestions. My Milo is home and we are trying to make him as comfortable as possible but he's really upset and doesn't want to be around us right now sadly. If I had known this to begin with, I wouldn't have registered him there. Feeling sad but glad to have had some feedback from you all.","num_comments":1093,"date_posted":"2025-07-02T15:50:30.346Z","community_name":"CatAdvice","num_upvotes":4434,"photos":null,"videos":null,"tag":"Behavioral","related_posts":[{"community":"cathelp","community_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CATHELP/comments/1m51nw3/crazy_situation_with_the_vet/","title":"Crazy situation with the vet…","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CATHELP/comments/1m51nw3/crazy_situation_with_the_vet/","thumbnail":null,"num_upvotes":"7005","num_comments":188},{"community":"cats","community_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/1kgetxl/is_i_weird_to_ask_someone_if_i_can_take_their_cat/","title":"Is I weird to ask someone if I can take their cat to a vet?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/1kgetxl/is_i_weird_to_ask_someone_if_i_can_take_their_cat/","thumbnail":null,"num_upvotes":"2042","num_comments":200},{"community":"cats","community_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/1kmk6oc/first_trip_to_the_vet_she_was_pissed/","title":"First trip to the vet.

This post did pretty well (thanks<3) so I've opted to make a similar post regarding the new reflection PL has released today. This reflection post is split into 4 categories: progression, monetization, gameplay, and core features. These can be summed up pretty well as the 4 things the community has been complaining about post-awakening, but the sub-categories aren't as promising. TL;DR, the post feels akin to a band aid fix, paying off players to stay quiet with in-game currency and not addressing any of the major issues the community has. The small amount of fixes are a step in the right direction, but the fact that these complaints were addressed before some of the more glaring issues makes me believe that the bigger picture won't be changed any time soon and the community will continue to be blamed for disliking it. Progression Reset PL are aware that players have frustrations over: Slayer's Path progression loss, Inadequate compensation, Pacing within the progression system being flawed. What PL have done to \"fix\" the issue: Compensation in the form of 300,000 Rams and 5,000 Combat Merits, Additional Aetherite for returning players, A price cut in the crafting of tier 3 weapon talents, Bonus rewards on behemoth kills, A change in progression flow for tonic crafting and dauntless trials. This is where the justification behind the \"band aid patch\" phrase stems from, instead of offering genuine fixes to a problem, the PL team are offering short-term compensation for the loss players have received, and very minor compensation at that. This ram increase and burst of currency isn't nearly enough to get to the levels players were at previously. This wasn't the only form of compensation though, Aetherite is being given out to returning players, which is completely contradictory to the previous post PL made. In the original post, PL mentioned that a reset in progression was necessary for players to re-learn the game and better understand the changes they've made, stating that player skill is what will drive returning players back to their former glory. However, with this constant influx of Aetherite, returning players won't need to rely on their \"skill\" to get back to where they were, but instead will spend their time in a menu levelling up their weapons with the handouts they've received. Will this aid in getting people back on track? By technicality, yes. But, this clashes so much with what PL mentioned before that it feels like they don't understand how to operate their own decisions. Monetization Practices PL are aware that players have frustrations over: Progression feeling locked behind a paywall, The existence of premium lootboxes, The removal of platinum rewards making the hunt pass feel underwhelming. What PL have done to \"fix\" the issue: The reveal of seasonal events, such as Frostfall, offering a free alternate to premium rewards, The addition of more platinum being added to the free and premium hunt passes, Premium Aetherite to be removed from the shop and made free to players, More Aetherite and Rams to be added to the hunt pass post level 50. Similar to the previous segment, the changes provided consist of just more rams and aetherite. It sounds like the solution PL are finding to a lot of their problems consist of giving out rams and aetherite while pretending the rest don't exist. The free and premium passes gaining more platinum is a good thing, making the hunt pass less of a downgrade, but the existence of loot boxes along with premium weapons locked behind the hunt pass are never addressed, meaning it's likely that these features are going to stay for the foreseeable future. From these two segments, there is a recurring theme that the PL team assume that players will be satisfied with enough free rewards to justify bad decisions, which makes me feel like they don't truly understand how the community of any get, let alone their own, works. People don't want more rams, they want weapons to spend their rams on. Technical and Gameplay Issues I'm going to skip over this section, as it simply addresses performance issues and bug reports, stating that the team have found them and are looking to tackle them within the next few updates. No real complaints as it's a bare minimum requirement for a game to run somewhat consistently, so at least there's an attempt in that being achieved. Loss of Core Features PL are aware that players have frustrations over: People dislike the removal of weapon crafting, The cell system sucks, Armour perks lack synergy and feel bad to combine optimally. What PL have done to \"fix\" the issue: Some armour perks have been moved around, Max shield cap has been increased, Some HUD changes. Oof, the big one. So, as you can see, there is no comment on weapon crafting being reintroduced or even considered by the PL team, indicating it's gone for good. The cell system remains the same without any balancing, and armour is still boring and tedious to build. Essentially, this change means nothing in the grand scheme of player discomfort and is the main talking point of this dev post. We can safely assume that these systems will stay as they are and balance patches will be extremely slow out the gate. Unfortunately, that means the game will continue to lose players before the previous power fantasies of dauntless are met, which could imply that the game will shut down before we ever reach those peaks again. And that is it from the dev post, another disappointment of an update from the PL team ensuring that less and less people have hope for the game's survival. Before you comment anything, I know that PL was acquired by an inexperienced crypto company and I know that a majority of the devs at PL have either been fired or moved on to other ventures, and I wish the best for all the creative minds behind the pre-awakening dauntless era. I've had more than enough comments telling me these two same things over and over, but I appreciate the interactions everyone has none-the-less. Do let me, and everyone else on this subreddit, know your opinions on the change and remember to be civil. Finally, remember to leave a negative review on Steam <3 Read

I've seen post after post of someone new to the series complain about how \"even the casual game mode is full of sweaty tryhards\" and I think the issue largely stems from the name. The skill range in this game is massive. Casual allows for Timmy 2 hours to fight against masters players and understandably makes them want to never play again. Honestly I can't blame them because to a new player it's intuitive to start with the CASUAL mode before you try and get ranked. In reality it's much better to take the losses in ranked and get placed with people who are around your skill level so you can actually enjoy the game but the naming of the modes suggests otherwise.

I'm not sure how to reconcile. How do I move past this? Thanks to u/soayherder & u/queenlegolas for suggesting this BoRU Trigger Warnings: child neglect, past child trauma, emotional neglect Mood Spoilers: frustrating, but hopeful Original Post : June 20, 2025 My (27M) family's broken, and I'm trying to reassemble the pieces. I need advice. For context, my wife (29F) and I are childhood sweethearts married now for around 5 years. I know we became parents and got married pretty young, but we've made it work. My wife's a small business owner. She turned a passion into a career. I'm really happy for her. When she started, I promised her that since my work hours were flexible, I'd hold things down at home so she could focus on building her business. We were a team until we weren't. My wife's an extreme workaholic, and it's come between our family. We're not in a good place. Our daughter's (10F) caregiving is solely on me. The time my wife and daughter spend together is made up mostly of short replies or silence. Our daughter isn't disrespectful. She's a good kid. She's just not as comfortable with her mom. My wife and I have had a lot of talks about the state of our family. With the business well off the ground and her not needing to personally oversee everything as often, we're working on reconnecting. It's been an uphill battle. Recently, we had a bad fight. She told me she's given up on trying with our daughter. She said she's not good at it, and she's just going to stay in her lane. I told her she couldn't decide to clock out on our daughter during rocky stints. She said she's emotionally exhausted from repeatedly striking out. She feels she can't do anything right in our daughter's eyes. She said I have it easy, that our daughter prefers me, and even made sure her whole class knew it. The class jab was about a school assignment. Our daughter had to interview someone she admired, and she asked me. My wife was hurt. She still feels a way about it. She accused me of not understanding. She comes home to a child she carried not respecting her. That our daughter's an expert critic when it comes to her. She went into a huge rant. The way she talked about her rubbed me the wrong way. I told her most of her complaints weren't our daughter's creation. She asked me what that meant, and I laid it out that she hasn't gone out of her way to connect with our daughter. She shut me down. She went into how she busts her ass for our family, and the least I could do is show up for her. All I do is show up for her, including holding down responsibilities that we're supposed to share. We aren't childless. It's no longer those me and her against the world days. I need to show up for our daughter too. She just kept saying she has a lot on her plate and how I'm supposed to be her peace. I refuted the only peace that ever seemed to matter these days was hers. She said our daughter and I are two of a kind and began sarcastically apologizing for her sacrifices, and if the business is what's driving us apart, then she'll renounce it. She'd make do. I asked if we could skip her martyr routine and actually talk. The fight only escalated. I called the fight a complete waste of time, but she interpreted that as me calling her a waste of time. It was the worst fight we had in a while. Our daughter was at her grandparents, so she didn't hear anything. We're at an impasse. Things are still tense. Idk how to clear the air or how to reach her about our daughter. She can't dismiss her like some disgruntled customer at work. In a lot of ways, I feel like a single parent. I don't believe she's being honest with herself about our issues. She's a distant figure who has a habit of talking at our daughter instead of to her. There are a lot of broken promises. Nothing ever mended. She doesn't try engaging. Our daughter loves anime, but my wife doesn't hold back on overly criticizing it in front of her. Our daughter got into K-pop, but to my wife it's just bothersome noise around the house or in the car. Our daughter has stage fright. Yet she joined a school play because she knows her mom loves theatre. My wife promised her she'd come. She didn't. The worst part was seeing our daughter realize she wasn't. My wife never apologized. She gave her, \"Work was busy. I promise next time\" speech. She offered to bring our daughter with her on Take Your Child to Work Day. I thought it'd be good for them and a chance for our daughter to see more of what her mom does. But our daughter called me upset and wanted me to pick her up. She said her mom had immediately left her with a subordinate and went awol. When my wife checked in on her, they fought. She told our daughter that a bratty attitude won't be tolerated in her workplace. She and I had it out later. She apologized to our daughter and blamed blowing up on work frustration. She offered to bring her back another day, but our daughter refused. My wife always felt she was bad at articulating her feelings. She feels she comes off aggressive. That's partly why she leaves our daughter's caretaking to me. But this fight has me questioning the nature of our relationship. I don't doubt she loves our daughter. I saw it firsthand during the pregnancy, and in our private conversations, she couldn't stop gushing about her. I felt her love in the little things. Idk something changed over overtime. My wife isn't close with her parents. She usually has me talk with them on her behalf. She has a mindset that parents/kids don't have to be close. She believes since she turned out fine, so will our daughter. I'm failing to help their relationship and our own. We barely have quality time. Intimacy is shot. When we're out together, we aren't really together because in public, she's hyperaware and has her business persona on. Idk what else to do. I'm at a loss. I'm not trying to bash my wife. I just want everyone to be ok. I'm in a fight for my family right now. How do I mend my wife's and daughter's relationship while also repairing my marriage? TL;DR My family's broken, and I'm trying to reassemble the pieces. My wife's an extreme workaholic, and it's come between our family. We're not in a good place. Our daughter's caregiving is solely on me. My wife and daughter's time together is mostly short replies/silence. We're working on reconnecting, but we had a bad fight.

How do I mend my wife's and daughter's relationship while also repairing my marriage? Relevant Comments Commenter 1: Wow. Your wife sounds broken. I don’t see this resolving itself without a lot of therapy on her part. This sounds like one of those situations where she loves her daughter but regrets being a mother. She probably had a traumatic childhood and no idea how to be a great mum. You can’t resolve this. Your wife has to want to do the work. Your choices seem to be accept that you are going to be a single father. You can either do that within the marriage or outside of it. OOP: Idk how to help her. She's shutdown the idea of counseling before. I feel like the situation's partially my fault. I should've been stepped in. I made excuses and thought things would get better Commenter 2: You can lead a horse to water you can’t make it drink. You could give your wife all the tools to be a more present mother but does she actually want to be one or is she giving the lip service of she wants to be but there’s no actions to follow the talk. Your wife needs to have a reset of what’s actually important to her if it’s work and only work then ok she’s not maternal and that’s ok some woman just don’t bond. But what has she looked in to to fix the issue Get your daughter therapy so she understands she’s not the problem and some people just don’t know how to be an active parent when they where so badly failed by there own parents they just don’t know how OOP: That's one of the things that blew my mind the most. A lot of my wife's efforts were surface level or lip service and somehow she expected a wonder to come from it. Rebuilding a relationship is going to take time. She was talking about our daughter like she was a grown woman or something. She's a kid, you're the adult here Has OOP's wife considered about marriage counseling? OOP: She hasn't in the past. I recommended marriage counseling before and she said it wasn't for her. She's not as open with others about her feelings. She really only opens up to me Commenter 3: I don’t think she actually wanted to give up. I think she was telling you she feels like giving up because it has become so painful - so saying she felt like giving up was like telling you it’s a 10 on the pain scale - not that she’s actually giving up. I also think that if she isn’t close with her parents, and never had ~how to be with a child~ demonstrated for her - she may genuinely not know what to do to make things better. She definitely needs help. I’d try giving her some assistance in how to relate (not in the form of a fight, but in the form of support) and if she can’t hear it from you because she feels too criticized - try bringing it to therapy. I’m guessing she’s feeling a lot of shame over not doing better than her parents - and shame makes us ignore things we need to look at. OOP: Thank you. I appreciate your comment. It's got me thinking about another side of where my wife could've been coming from. I feel bad about the right. It hasn't done anyone any favors. My wife hasn't been open to therapy in the past. She didn't think she needed it Commenter 4: You're not overreacting. You're reacting. \"I don't doubt she loves our daughter. I saw it firsthand during the pregnancy, and in our private conversations, she couldn't stop gushing about her. I felt her love in the little things. Idk something changed over overtime.\" Start with this statement. That you don't doubt her love for your daughter but ask also ask her what changed? Why does she not want to engage with your daughter? Why is it hard? Try not to make it sound like a fight but that you're coming from a place of wanting to understand. Her work is definitely a factor in this. I may be reading into this too much into this but I wonder if your wife is over compensating in some way. As if being successful in her career makes up for her lack of success as a parent. Even if she is not too aware of it. Can you ask her to take a step back from her work to focus on reconnecting? Can you suggest reconnecting as a family as she doesn't feel she has to do it all on her own? I am going to echo the other comment and suggest family therapy. That could give you more tools to work with instead of figuring this out on your own. OOP: I should've tried that route. I regret the fight. The conversation went wrong so fast and blew up. That's what I meant by the fight being a waste of time So the plan was for my wife to step back from work in order for us to reconnect as a family and couple. I thought we'd have the freedom because there are more hands on deck at her business now but it seems like she looks for any reason to be back in the fray Downvoted Commenter: Seems like the same dynamic people have grown up with for a long time except it’s usually the dad saying this. Maybe get a better job and bring in more money so she doesn’t feel like she has so much pressure on her to produce financially and be whatever perfect wife and parent you want her to be on top of it. 🤷🏼‍♀️ OOP: My job isn't the issue. We both bring an income to the household. I just always could be more flexible with my hours which was why I took on holding things down at home while my wife built her business. The financial wellbeing of our family isn't unevenly placed on her. I'm not asking her to be perfect. I just want her to genuinely show up, be involved and not toss our daughter to the side Update : July 5, 2025 (two weeks later) Thank you to everyone who reached out. It helped a great deal. My (27M) original post was pretty much the first time I talked about any of this. I wanted to give an update. My wife (29F) and I had a serious discussion about everything. It took us a while to get there because things were still tense after our last fight and our mini spats in between. Our daughter noticed the rift between her mom and me. She asked me about it. I'm not proud of that. I never wanted her involved in our fights. It was a larger wake-up call. I shouldn't have let it drag out. My wife asked if we could talk, and we both apologized for the fight. She was worried that I was calling it quits after how bad our last fight was. She took us not recovering as quickly as usual and my distance as me being done. She wanted to make a gesture for our marriage. I told her that her harsh action towards our daughter had made me question our relationship. She said she felt bad for intensely ranting about our daughter. She was overwhelmed and used the situation as a punching bag. She loves our daughter but is at a loss as a parent. I told her we'd all keep being at a loss in our current state. We're disconnected as a couple and a family. I feel like a single parent and alone in our marriage. Our current way isn't working. Her lack of presence is the common root cause. I didn't feel like our daughter or I actually mattered and were more put up with by her. That statement really bothered her. She denied it and promised our family does matter to her. She said she knows things aren't good right now, but she wants our family. That she gets frustrated and says stuff she doesn't mean, but it doesn't equate to how she actually feels. I told her it's not just her words. It's her actions. Her harshness and how she chooses everything over our family every single time while expecting us to just have smiles on our faces. We're not props, and I can't enforce a relationship between her and our daughter. She said she has trouble with contentment, and it's an endless chase. She has this need to keep chasing after an inner feeling she's always felt she missed. We talked about the feeling before. It's a high and feeling whole. She said she thought our relationship was the answer, she thought our daughter was the answer, and then she thought her business would completely fill that void. She said she doesn't know how to be with our daughter. When our daughter was a baby, everything was easier, that our daughter would get excited when she came home from work, that no matter what she did or didn't do, she had our daughter's love. But she's older now and barely seems to like being in the same room as her and clings to me. I asked if she's considered that maybe our daughter's hurting from her criticism and broken promises. My wife feels she's doing better than her parents. She said all our daughter knows is the grandpa and grandma who adore her over FaceTime. She doesn't know what they were like. Her childhood was staying in a child's place, doing what was expected of you, representing the family, and attitudes weren't tolerated. There wasn't a problem they couldn't solve with a belt. My wife said she doesn't believe in the belt as discipline, but she doesn't know how to be with our daughter and fears she's aggressive when communicating, so she leaves our daughter to me. She doesn't feel she's good as a mother to an older child or with expressing personal feelings. She said I knew what her parents were like. She's right. My in-laws ran an unforgiving household. My wife was pretty much a latchkey kid. My FIL was always working, and my MIL was busy with her community engagements. Feelings were compared to complaining, and there were certain expectations of my wife. I was 17 and my wife was 19 when we had our daughter. Of course the circumstances weren't ideal, but my in-laws made you feel their disapproval. There wasn't support to be found from them. They told my wife that if she was grown enough to make a baby, then she was grown enough to take on the responsibilities on her own. My in-laws have mellowed out a lot now, but my wife is no contact with them. She used her business to pay off their house, and that was that. I'm the buffer between them. I'm accustomed to being my wife's protector. That was always our dynamic. Especially during the pregnancy, when everyone had commentary, were comedians, or when guys would talk about her. Looking back, I think that's part of why I made excuses for her actions with our daughter. I told my wife that I'm in love with her, but our daughter can't be at the expense of our relationship. We're at a crossroads. Something needed to change. Counseling isn't an option anymore. It's happening for our daughter and me. I want for us to come through this as a family. If she refuses counseling, I'd respect her decision, but her answer would give me my answer on what I needed to do for the best of our daughter. We'd have to separate for the time being. My wife said if it's between counseling or losing our family, then she chooses counseling. She wants to keep working on our marriage and reconnecting as a family. We're not props. I asked if this was what she really wanted. If we do this, it can't be her showing up in word only but looking for any reason to skip out. She said what we built means something to her, and losing that has become more real to her now. I talked with our daughter about her feelings on counseling too. I didn't just want to randomly throw an appointment on her. She was pretty open to the idea. I think it's because she's close with my parents and she knows they do counseling. My wife and I are officially in counseling. We're trying a conjoint therapy approach for right now. It's a new experience for us. Prior to this, my wife was never big on counseling, but she has been showing up. She hasn't flaked. There has been some improvement with my wife and daughter. My wife has pulled back on criticism and asking our daughter questions. Recently, we went to an amusement park as a family, and they had a good time together on some rides. My wife asked to pair with our daughter on a few games too. It was the first time in a long time I saw them share a laugh. Nothing's perfect. We're in the early stages. I know my wife and daughter's relationship will be a long road. I know how it pans out isn't up to me, but I'm here to support our daughter in whatever she needs. Idk what the future holds, but I want to be hopeful for my family. Maybe it's not too late. I want the best for everyone involved. Our daughter will be starting middle school soon, and I told my wife that she'll need both of us. I'm hoping this road isn't the end of my family. I want us to have to come through this together. When I chose a life with her, it wasn't because we were having a baby, so let's stick together. It was because I love her and want to be with her. I want to make this work. Thank you to everyone again. I appreciate the support. It's much appreciated. TL;DR Update for: My family's broken, and I'm trying to reassemble the pieces. My wife's an extreme workaholic, and it's come between our family. We're not in a good place. Our daughter's caregiving is solely on me. My wife and daughter's time together is mostly short replies/silence. We're working on reconnecting, but we had a bad fight. She's given up on trying to connect with our daughter. She said she's not good at it, and she's just going to stay in her lane. She feels she can't do anything right in our daughter's eyes. It was our worst fight in a while. Now we're at an impasse. In a lot of ways, I feel like a single parent. I'm failing to help their relationship. I just want everyone to be ok. How do I mend my wife's and daughter's relationship while also repairing my marriage? Relevant / Top Comments Commenter 1: Does she want your kids to be around her parents? You act as buffer but I wonder if she actually wants that or if it feels like some kind of betrayal OOP: My wife had asked me to handle contact with her parents because she didn't want to deal with it. She never had a blow up with her parents or told them she's no contact. I think her parents get the gist but it's an ignored elephant in the room. My wife's had backlash from other family over her distance. She let's our daughter have a relationship with them to avoid her parents claiming she's withholding their granddaughter Commenter 2: This is a good start. I will add that your wife needs individual counseling. She will never be able to fill that void in her with other things or people. She has to fill it within herself. Good luck to you and keep looking out for your daughter Commenter 3: I really hope everything goes works out for this family. It seems everyone is trying and I'm hoping the initial progress OP has reported will make it easier for all of them to keep going and making more progress. I think the wife got a wake up call and realizes how close they came to not making it as a couple. Commenter 4: This all seems really good first steps. I hope they continue to be good steps. Your wife desperately needs indivisible counseling though. That void feeling and the other trauma her parents inflicted on her won't be able to be addressed in marital counseling. And not getting that addressed will very likely just be a shadow waiting to take back over either with a new \"this will fill it\" or go back to an old one. Not saying you have to push it immediately, and maybe the counselor you're seeing now will bring it up, but it needs to be one of the steps along the way.

As someone who has dealt with depression since early adulthood and have an almost 13 yo daughter, I know the signs. My daughter is a volatile mini version of me. Connecting to her at your daughter’s age was a struggle for me. I really empathized with your wife until the theater thing. I also did theater, but this is where my daughter and I have gotten close! I saw the opportunity and ran with it. It seems like your daughter was actively trying to engage, but your wife just dropped the ball. This also makes me lean toward a her possibly being depressed. Hopefully she sees the conversation and resulting counseling for the opportunity it is. She needs to learn how to enjoy the little things in life again. Don’t give up yet.

You'd think that knowing your parents were bad and knowing how it impacted you, and you'd want the world for your child, even with all that, what behavior actually happens is sooooo much more governed by your traumatized self rather than your \"i understand i have been hurt and id never wanna repeat that\". the \"knowledgeable\" part just judges and drowns you in shame. I haven't ever been to therapy and only ever journalled which helped me a lot but i realized there were some desires/behaviors that i was just a mere observer too. Something i could talk, dissect, analyse a million times but wouldn't really change. Desires/behaviors out my control, quite possibly in control of my trauma. And that is what scares me the most, its sort of a \"history is bound to repeat, even if people know abt it\". Certainly, journalling and writing abt it and all that amazing stuff probably isnt the solution, there has to be something more concrete which id assume therapy works on. But still, loss of control is frightening","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1lxr4c9/comment/n2x5upp/","user_commenting":"Living-Shopping-9471","user_url":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Living-Shopping-9471/","date_of_comment":"2025-07-13T16:25:40.975Z","num_upvotes":2,"num_replies":0,"replies":[]}],"community_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/","community_description":"**What happened to people who ask reddit for advice or help?** \n\nDid they take Reddit's advice?

Like personally i’ve not been super invested in this beta, i’ve been kind of over it since anaxa, only so-so on phainon and busy irl.. but just going over to showcases etc to see how phainon plays it’s been very jarring seeing people going on about how husbando fans and phainon mains are doomposting. From what i’ve seen there’s not even been massive drama despite him being the big boy of 3.4. His beta has had less attention than Anaxa’s lol. His subs are relatively peaceful and this sub isn’t on fire. This is tame asf Honestly i see more people freak out over doomposting than genuine doomposting and that’s while checking this sub which people consistently shit on as the most toxic doompost place. I know no one wants to hear it but it does feel like husbando fans (mostly women let’s not obfuscate) have just been made the community punching bag and scapegoat where yall can say anything and people will say it’s unreasonable and toxic and doomposting. People are engaging in “fun” online dogpiling of a disliked group as catharsis which ofc just so happens to be mostly women with the excuse of criticizing unreasonable people. Hysterical bitches etc. Acheronmains lost their minds last patch over having to pull one whole guy ever but you won’t see that being used against waifu fans or even acheron fans, everyone forgets it immediately. But if you’re disappointed or upset over phainon getting a clunky kit that only a specialized waifu support could help, you’re crazy and toxic and wow look at these husbando fans bitching again. Even though people would obviously hope for something truly nice if we get a treat once every 2 years. Idk. Engaging with people in good faith feels pointless atp. The showcases are utter ass, people are just fighting eachother over unrelatable 0 cycle clears and no one is ever willing to hear out why “a husbando fan” might be upset, they’ve already written them off as an irrational bitch to start. Which they will never question internally no matter which sub you step into. The misogyny in hsr spaces has gotten 10 times worse the past year and i don’t rly have the energy to fight people about it. The gooners and the dumb people who fall for their pretend concerns can eat shit, what else can i say. There is no winning unless you just act happy about every small scrap you get like the people who somehow made it through natlan.

Let's say image ... It's not what you say but how you say it. I wholeheartedly agree that predatory monetisation techniques like locking kit improvements behind dupes or needing dedicated supports to make the character \"work\" should not be accepted, so from that point of view I'm on the side of the Phainon wanters. Same with other complaints like the lack of male characters. Now the issue comes on how a lot of you gals and guys complain about these problems the entire oh yeah when their fktoy shilled Castorice is broken they're not complaining but now when we want a strong male character there's a problem! Or Ofc the gooners don't want male characters they only want their \"insert here derogatory insult\" so they can jerk off . Doesn't that sound bad? Don't you think that you're just going to antagonise other people who are as emotionally invested in whatever waifu as you are into Phainon, the more people feel like they're antagonised the more they'll have a knee-jerk reaction to disagree with a particular topic even if they normally would agree, just because it's something that the people who antagonised them care about. (You see this in politics, when a party shots down pretty much anything that the opposition wants even if it's something that they'd normally agree with or that would damage their reputation if they shot it down, but they do it simply because it's the opposition who brought it up) An important life lesson is that people will go against you even if they agree with what you say if the way you say it ticks them the wrong way, it's not what you say but how you say it.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/HSRHusbandoMains/comments/1lavouk/comment/mxqcnqk/","user_commenting":"RexThePug","user_url":"https://www.reddit.com/user/RexThePug/","date_of_comment":"2025-06-14T12:36:50.497Z","num_upvotes":0,"num_replies":0,"replies":[]},{"comment":"I think this is really more of a game design issue where they've been designing DPS to be reliant on premium teams, and Phainon really happens to have such a unique kit that needs very unique solutions. It sucks if you don't want to invest in his supports, but imo if you're pulling a DPS w/o planning to get at least one premium support for them, then that's on you. I agree that his issues WILL be more noticeable than other characters once shilling ends. It is the same fate that Acheron and Firefly ultimately got, but people are pretty much in denial because they pulled for their tailor-made supports and atp they also vertically invested in them.

Overguard is fine as it is for separating the big bads from the little bads. but when everyone and everything has OG, and OG still favors damage over CC, those two combined can become a problem, and it's very much a step in the wrong direction for Ancient Protectors to be designed that way imo. if Overguard is to remain unchanged, just change how Protectors work. if Protectors are to still give everyone Overguard even after its own death, then maybe OG should be looked at to account for that fact.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1idw3ux/comment/ma32nog/","user_commenting":"HarrowAssEnthusiast","user_url":"https://www.reddit.com/user/HarrowAssEnthusiast/","date_of_comment":null,"num_upvotes":1,"num_replies":0,"replies":[]},{"comment":"My only complaint is the Corrupted Ancient spam that grants the trash mobs overguard, it's just annoying to deal with. \"Special\" enemies having overguard is a non issue to me personally, as CC will always be secondary to damage","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1idw3ux/comment/ma2yrmi/","user_commenting":"NOOXXUSSSS","user_url":"https://www.reddit.com/user/NOOXXUSSSS/","date_of_comment":null,"num_upvotes":1,"num_replies":0,"replies":[]},{"comment":"The issue is that clearly the players using cc frames loooooove interception and mobile defense and are having trouble in those missions they play all the time and definitely don't just slow down actual missions where killing fast is the objective.

She uses Khora prime right now. We are both happy with our weapons, we use them a lot, and we like shooting things. That isn't the issue. And yes, we are using magnetic. My tenet arca plasmor and her kuva sobek both have magnetic bonus. And yes we are able to kill enemies; me faster than her, but that's just because I have a better build and wisp. The issue is that her strangledome just doesn't do anything now. If there were less enemies with overguard, or if killing the protector got rid of the overguard, I would actually like the new protectors. I think they're a cool concept. But currently SO MANY protectors spawn. We've been going to rotation C and stopping, for voruna parts, and it's just so painful having so many abilities be useless. And again, I don't mind shooting enemies. I'm constantly shooting enemies either way because my gun is fun AF. That's not the problem here. The problem is the fact that you're now forced to either not use CC abilities on frames that have them, or just switch frames. With my wisp coming up on 200% ability strength, we can melt through the enemies with breach surge, and we have decent survivability, and I subsumed orphanim eyes from jade as well which helps us out with armored enemies. My wife LOVED Khora before, and still does on the missions that don't have those protectors. But now those missions are not just harder, but unfun because it's pointless to bring along CC abilities when half of the enemies will be immune. Sure, she could just switch to saryn prime and nuke everything. And we could just specifically build around our guns and use them to kill everything. But the point is that she shouldn't have to. Idk why DE has this vendetta against CC, but it's not actually making things much harder, it's only shutting down specific frames and playstyles. As a note, I think circulus on lua has more corrupted enemies than you find at any old void fissure, and thus more of those protectors, so that's probably contributing to our issues. I don't think it's that bad other places but we haven't been doing much elsewhere. But the point still stands, whether it's only lua or everywhere. And also we don't INSTANTLY melt all enemies, we're at least somewhat new to steel path. We have a pretty complete collection of mods but not all our arcanes are maxed yet. We're not one shotting the stuff with overguard, and her strangledome doesn't generally kill things, she uses it almost exclusively for CC. So maybe we're having more issues because we're not LR4 with integer overflow damage, but we really shouldn't have to be, it's not that high level and we're only going to 20 minutes per run.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1idw3ux/comment/ma2tqc0/","user_commenting":"Darkpenguins38","user_url":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Darkpenguins38/","date_of_comment":null,"num_upvotes":3,"num_replies":0,"replies":[]},{"comment":"the biggest issue is really at higher higher ends on defense based missons or missions with a potentially killable objective.

The game launched in early access back in December 2021, and in many ways, it could be said that it was a better game than the full launch in 2023. With each major update, more and more bugs are introduced. Many of these bugs are only noticeable to veterans; others are apparent to most players. The Devs have promised to fix some of these bugs, such as the graphics downgrade (which they said was a bug, but the more jaded of us think was intentional, but due to backlash, they have promised to change). The point is that getting it now and in a few months likely won't be much different. It can be a decent way to turn off your brain and play if your friends have it. Although personally, I never enjoyed the single-player aspect, many do. So if you want to get the game, go for it, although, as many will joke, you can always get SWAT 4 on GOG if you want an alternative. Honestly, with mods it doesn't look too much worse ;).","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ReadyOrNotGame/comments/1m5ayy1/comment/n4au8m0/","user_commenting":"Neither_Bath_5775","user_url":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Neither_Bath_5775/","date_of_comment":null,"num_upvotes":3,"num_replies":0,"replies":[]},{"comment":"I still bought it, play it everyday and love it. don’t let reddit persuade your opinion on anything, these people are the minority on everything","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ReadyOrNotGame/comments/1m5ayy1/comment/n4athzd/","user_commenting":"fight-for-freedoms","user_url":"https://www.reddit.com/user/fight-for-freedoms/","date_of_comment":null,"num_upvotes":10,"num_replies":2,"replies":[{"user_replying":"West_Ad_7325","user_url":"https://www.reddit.com/user/West_Ad_7325/","reply":"Bro you’re fighting for your life here.

And that’s why we, the players, are the real problem.","description":"I seriously can’t believe how Monster Hunter Wilds managed to launch in this state. After a long-ass development cycle, tons of feedback, and a massive budget, Capcom still put out a steaming pile of unoptimized garbage. I say this as a die-hard fan of the franchise. I’ve put 1k+ hours into most MH games. But at this point, I’m fucking done with how devs are treating us. Capcom used to be the golden child , yet now they’re churning out poorly optimized , bug-ridden , and microtransaction-infested trash. And the worst part? We are the real problem. We bitch and moan about these abusive practices, but guess what? We keep buying the damn games. Some of us even pre-order them , basically paying upfront for an unfinished product. Just look at this fucking insanity : 🔹 1.1 million players online right now. 🔹 All-time peak of 1.38 million. 🔹 Just days after launch, despite being a technical disaster. We keep rewarding mediocrity , so why the hell would Capcom change anything? They see us eating this shit up , and they will keep serving it. Here's a list of just how broken this game is: 💀 Reflex is broken 💀 HDR is broken (calibrated for 1000 Nit displays, looks like shit on anything else) 💀 Texture settings are broken (MIPS settings are messed up, leading to textures looking worse than intended) 💀 DirectStorage is broken 💀 Texture streaming is a disaster (textures load and unload constantly just from moving the camera) 💀 Ridiculous pop-in (literally worse than last-gen games) 💀 DLSS implementation is garbage (manually adding the .DLLs improves it because Capcom can't even do that right) 💀 Denuvo is active in-game (because fuck performance, right?) 💀 Capcom’s own anti-tamper is ALSO active (running on every MH Wilds thread—because why not kill performance even more? ) 💀 Depth of Field is an invisible FPS killer (especially in the third area) 💀 Ray tracing is not worth using (performance hit is absurd for minimal visual gain) 💀 They literally built the game’s performance around Frame Generation , despite both Nvidia and AMD explicitly saying FG is NOT meant for sub-60 FPS gaming . And yet, here we are, watching the game soar to the top of the charts. We keep accepting this garbage . We enable companies to ship unfinished and unoptimized games because they know we’ll just keep buying them anyway . Capcom has absolutely zero reason to change when people keep throwing money at them. I love Monster Hunter, but this is fucking disgraceful.

This is the first MH title i've refunded, and that's with specs that can brute-force the issues and play the game in an enjoyable enough state to still warrant the purchase. I'm a person that has always had great faith that they'd treat their golden-goose IP with the deserved love and respect, so I was one of the people who bought the ultra-shiny-deluxe-edition™ I played the beta. I found it rough, but playable. After hearing so many people talk about how the \"full release\" was going to be optimized better and have the much desired hit stop added to really add to that meaty feeling of the game, I was convinced into pre-ordering. Cue launch day, and I am filled with negativity towards the overall product that was presented to me. I could immediately tell right off the bat that nothing had really improved and that what I could expect out of Wilds was more or less just an unoptimized muddy mess that tugs on my heart strings by unfortunately having gameplay that slaps hard. I considered whether or not I wanted to push through the performance issues in order to keep playing, but as more and more came to light (especially learning that it had both denuvo and an in-house anti tamper) I was convinced that they cared far more about the overall sales figure then the player experience. It's genuinely just unfortunate all around. It's created a civil war between MH fans, and I don't see that mixed rating changing anytime soon until things are addressed. It's doing it's job of causing a lot of people who are interested in the franchise for the first time to step off warily, so I imagine Capcom will be forced to address it sooner or later. In the meantime, we can just wait. The game will always be there, and honestly if I have to wait a few years down the line for Denuvo to be removed and other optimized mods/fixes to come through the be able to enjoy the game and eek out the performance I know I should be getting, then that's fine too. Ideally, I just choose to view this as a bunch of people beta-testing the game for me while it's in it's rough state, submitting feedback, and then later down the line i'll invariably get to reap the beneficial rewards of better performance and more content that gets added.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1j3atl9/comment/mg13egx/","user_commenting":"ProjektXIII","user_url":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ProjektXIII/","date_of_comment":"2025-03-04T21:05:50.000Z","num_upvotes":10,"num_replies":0,"replies":[]}],"community_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/","community_description":"Join the discussion, share your art, and hunt monsters.

Originally posted to r/AITAH Thanks to u/queenlegolas for suggesting this BoRU Original Post Apr 25, 2025 Hi everyone. This actually happened last night. I was at my brother's place for an NFL Draft party. I haven't seen my brother in a couple weeks, and my brother and I live a couple hours from each other because I moved away so I haven't seen a lot of his friends in years. I also have not met most of my brother's girlfriend's family and friends because she comes from a town a couple hours from where they currently live in the opposite direction from where I live. My brother and his gf have been together 2 years and are getting engaged next month. At the party I was talking with a group of people and one guy, the husband of one of my brother's girlfriend's friends asked me what I do for a living, and I said I'm an attorney. He then asked me what kind of law I practice, and I could already see where this was going. He then started into a \"so I'm having a problem with one of my neighbors...\"\" As he was launching into his story I reached in my pocket and gave him my card and told him to call me in the morning to discuss the issue. He got upset and said why can't I just answer a couple of quick questions for him since we were both there. I said I was there to see my brother and watch the draft and didn't want to discuss business right now. As other attorneys will tell you at social gatherings this is a common thing. Once people find out you're an attorney they'll try to corner you with a bunch of questions and you're basically back on the clock. Years ago, I decided to do the business card thing instead of answering questions so I could actually enjoy social gatherings. Besides, these things almost never turn into actual business, people just want free legal advice. I've never had any complaints about it before. The guy got upset, said something under his breathe, and stormed off. The other people standing there all made a face as he stormed off and we went right back into our conversation. That was it, or so I thought. The rest of the night was fine, and it was never brought up again. We enjoyed the draft, and I enjoyed seeing my brother's knucklehead friends these years later. I got a text from my brother this morning, and he said I want to make this clear, I completely understand why you did what you did. He has seen it happen a bunch of times at events and heard me complain about it afterwards. However, his girlfriend is upset that I \"blew her friend's husband off\" and wants me to reach out to him apologize and answer his questions. My brother said he's on my side and said he told her such, but she made him send the text to me anyway. I believe my brother being on my side and understand he's trying to keep the peace in his relationship. I said I'm not texting and apologizing or calling the guy but he has my card and is welcome to call me. I feel I did nothing wrong, just because of my job doesn't mean I'm on the clock 24/7. My brother said yea, I knew you'd say that but now I can at least tell my gf I tried and that was it with him. Again, I thought this was the end, but it's not. His girlfriend texted my mom and told her what happened. Now my mom is texting me and saying I know it's annoying what this guy did, but can you call this guy so that your relationship with brother's girlfriend isn't negatively affected because she's obviously upset with you. My brother is getting engaged to her next month and she's going to be family and there's no need to have a rift when she's about to be family. I said it's too late the fact that she cried to my mom already created a rift on my end about her now. Again, I declined, and my mom said she understands, but just doesn't want negative feelings with brother's gf over this. I said no, he can call me and I'll answer any questions he has. So, Reddit, AITAH for how I handled this? RELEVANT COMMENTS Dull_Vegetable5254 NTA. People, even family and friends, must understand that there are set boundaries. Your time, expertise, and education have value. Just because someone knows you personally doesn't mean they're entitled to free legal advice/services. Respecting your work means they're respecting your process. Also, girlfriend sounds like a red flag, considering she even texted your mom. OOP Yea, I was minorly annoyed she had my brother reach out to me, but once she got my mom involved, now I'm actually annoyed. ~ Kitchen_Pop_9236 The fact that your brother's girlfriend feels like she has any agency in this situation is strange. Don't apologize for shit. They're mad now, later they won't be. NTA OOP TBH I could care less if this guy who lives 4-5 hours away that I may never see again except once at their wedding and then never again is mad. I only care about my brother's gf and only to the extent that she's probably giving my brother an earful over it and that sucks for him and her being a future part of the family having a rift over something so stupid is unfortunate Kitchen_Pop_9236 Totally get you. By 'they're mad' I absolutely meant your SIL too. IMO, the more energy you give this, the more it feeds her. Set the boundary, then don't engage on it. This is a strategy that is employed when dealing with narcissistic people. OOP Yea, ever since my mom stopped asking about it I stopped talking to any of them about it. This is also very out of character for my brother's gf. Not sure why this was a triggering point for her Update July 2, 2025 I have some small updates on this post I made a couple of months ago. My brother got engaged to the gf referenced in the post a couple of weeks ago. They had a get together to celebrate their engagement this past weekend. They only invited immediate family and those they expect to be in their wedding party. My brother had asked me about being his best man last week before the party, but at the dinner they formally gave gifts to everyone in their wedding party along with officially asking everyone to be in the wedding party. Said brother's fiancé's friend's husband was there as well. He is not going to be in the wedding party, but his wife apparently will be. I was there before he was and when he came in he made no attempt to come over and say hello to me or the group I was talking with. Fine, I hardly know the guy, so I don't care if he talks to me. At dinner there were no assigned seats, but my girlfriend and I happen to be seated not super close to him and his wife, but close enough to where we could hear each other's conversations if we weren't involved in our own conversations. At dinner I was sitting with my girlfriend next to me on the same side they were seated, On my other side was my sister and her husband and across from me was some other friends of my brother's fiancé I had never met before this night. My girlfriend was not at the previous event, but I of course had told her about the issue. Anyway, my girlfriend and I are making small talk with the friends of my brother's fiancé across from us and of course what we all do for a living came up. I said I was an attorney and the guy at that point decided to interject into our conversation and say but don't ask him any questions right now, he'll just give you his card and tell you to call him during business hours. To my delight and his horror, one of the friends we were talking to responded and said, yea of course, I'd hardly expect him to give me legal advice at his brother's engagement party. He made an angry face, mumbled something to his wife, who told him to drop it, and then I don't think he said a word again the rest of the night. Nothing big, just thought some might find this update amusing. FINAL COMMENTS thumb_of_justice As a fellow attorney, I applaud you. That guy is so self-absorbed and entitled. I fucking hate people who expect free off-the-cuff advice and have no understanding of the fact that actually lawyers need to do legal research in order to give good advice. Not to mention that we need to do conflict checks. How did your future SIL treat you? I hope she got over her snit. Not cool that she called your mom to tattle on you. It sounds like your bro is marrying a jerk. OOP Thank you. It is great to hear a fellow attorney thinks I handled this well. She got over it, pretty quickly. Didn't apologize but didn't change the way she acted with me either. Her and I aren't close, and I don't think we ever will be, but we've remained cordial. Material_Assumption As a fellow human being who doesn't want to talk about work (background is IT and new career hvac), i also applaud you. Bruh, you want IT consult, pay me. You want me to troubleshoot your furnace/AC, same thing. You don't know how to set up a shared drive, my 16yo cousin can do something so basic, go ask him. Your AC doesn't work, bruh I promise you nobody can diagnose your issue with the only symptom you can articulate is thermostat calls for cool, but house dont cool.

I've raises this issue to netease many times and they just apologize and move on, they aren't interested in fixing anything. It's crazy, If they just care about the american playerbase why would they name the server NA/EU... Many people say It's because the playerbase there IS much bigger and I honestly disagree, at most, the playerbase in america and In Europe is equal, but It's even worse if you think about not only europeans but the rest of the players that don't have their own server (south america, africa...) because you can't possibly believe the american playerbase is still bigger than the rest(? SIGH I don't know, I still have hope that maybe someday, if our server becomes a bit relevant in tournaments they could maybe start caring about our ping... But until then we'll have to suffer being nerfed against all americans 💔 and stay silent while they complain about their 70 ms. At least, if people really think the american playerbase is so much bigger, they should make It so the ping is favoured depending on where are the majority of players in a match, instead of favouring americans if there is only one of them. Then It shouldn't be a problem since the european playerbase is so much smaller then It wouldn't happen that often.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/IdentityV/comments/1l8jkz3/comment/mx7ubml/","user_commenting":"kogan_jax","user_url":"https://www.reddit.com/user/kogan_jax/","date_of_comment":null,"num_upvotes":9,"num_replies":0,"replies":[]},{"comment":"If just ping was a problem.

Soo if your kite was bad or your team died fast apparently it can be just ping and from the start you probably have 0% chance to win.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/IdentityV/comments/1l8jkz3/comment/mx5wt4l/","user_commenting":"BibiBSReal","user_url":"https://www.reddit.com/user/BibiBSReal/","date_of_comment":null,"num_upvotes":21,"num_replies":0,"replies":[]},{"comment":"They literally don't care at all, I already realized that our comments mean nothing to them since on PC the button \"feedback\" doesn't exist lol.

But I’m worried a few issues will start to wear on the player base if not addressed. The main issue I have been seeing is people leaving matches. Nothing sucks more than being down by 1 goal and someone on your team rage quitting. I think there needs to be much harsher punishments for leaving matches early. The desync. I saw the dev post talking about this issue and how they will work to fix it. I just hope it comes soon. I’ve shown some friends this game and by far the biggest complaint is how sometimes it feels like the ball isn’t being detected correctly. False goals are the main culprit, but it also happens a lot when challenging on defense. The menu system for ranked needs some quality of life improvements. I have played 4 games of ranked and have no idea how close I am to being done with my placement matches. This one is minor, but still feels like a weird omission compared to other games with ranked modes. The final issue is more subjective, but I wish there was a more consistent way to receive a pass. It feels like so often the ball is bouncing over my player’s head or my teammate’s head when I pass. My natural reaction to a ball starting to bounce over my head is to try and header it in the direction I want to go, but that usually results in my character just going fish mode and flopping into the air while missing the ball completely. Admittedly this could just be a skill and issue and it could be working how the devs intend. It’s just something I’ve seen my friends annoyed at and I myself get a little frustrated when I lob pass to a teammate from goal only to have it bounce over their head and then roll to the other team’s keeper. Sorry if these have been brought up already, but I didn’t see anything on the front page of the subreddit addressing these four things. I’m curious if anyone else is also struggling with these issues. Even with these in mind this game has become a new favorite of mine, and I’m excited to see where it goes from here!

It feels like so often the ball is bouncing over my player’s head or my teammate’s head when I pass. My natural reaction to a ball starting to bounce over my head is to try and header it in the direction I want to go, but that usually results in my character just going fish mode and flopping into the air while missing the ball completely. Admittedly this could just be a skill and issue and it could be working how the devs intend. It’s just something I’ve seen my friends annoyed at and I myself get a little frustrated when I lob pass to a teammate from goal only to have it bounce over their head and then roll to the other team’s keeper. You have to either be on the reticle for the balls bounce path when it lands there OR you have to make an input on-time on the ball when you are within range to take control of it. This input could be a Square/X + R1/RB lob pass, like a header to a friend - but it could also be a 0 power ground pass in the direction you're going to sprint towards, or better in most cases, using the push ball X/A input and a direction to receive the pass with control. If the ball is moving faster, your opportunity to make an input will be earlier during the airtime of the ball- and you still need to be within range of the arc of the ball for the input reticle to even appear. You also have to \"beat\" anyone else to the ball with your input, the timing of everyone's input matters as much as their distance to the ball does. Using \"Extra Effort\" sprint bar during your action also helps give you priority in 50/50 situations. It helps to also know that if you're using Extra Effort your feet will have physical contact with a ball you \"run over\", but you won't have full control over the ball at the same time unless you slow down - you'll kick it forward with each step while your feet are glowing. This is all intended and a core aspect of the gameplay in this game, something I doubt they will change because it makes sense and works well once you understand it.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Rematch/comments/1lkcaoo/comment/mzqmkpl/","user_commenting":"ColeWoah","user_url":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ColeWoah/","date_of_comment":null,"num_upvotes":2,"num_replies":1,"replies":[{"user_replying":"officeaddict","user_url":"https://www.reddit.com/user/officeaddict/","reply":"Thanks for explaining!

They hired me when I graduated, and I had my 30 service years before I turned 50. With 30 service years you can get your full pension at any age. I worked until my first grandchild was born, then I retired to be 'grandma daycare.' I have 5 grands 8 male from my stepson, 7 male from my son, 5 female and 18 month male from my daughter. I babysat all of them with no issues or complaints. I still keep the 18 month old Monday-Friday and the older ones Summer and school holidays. My stepdaughter and her boyfriend has been non-stop drama since before the baby was born. When she was 10 weeks pregnant they presented a 3 page list of rules for when I was babysitting. They said if I didn't sign it, they wouldn't allow me to babysit. I said that I understood their need to do what was best for their baby and I assured them that there would be no hurt feelings on my end when they made other childcare arrangements. Some of the rules were almost understandable but most were down right ridiculous, and none of it was going to work for me. I don't remember them all but some examples are: I can't take the baby anywhere without their permission; I can't watch more than 1 additional child while babysitting; I can't cook; I had to provide the full name, dob and address of any potential visitors ahead of time for their approval of the person being 'around' their child; they have to know anytime I have a guest over and know who it is and how long they stay; My 9 year old cat would have to be kept out of rooms where the baby would be, even when the baby wasn't there; I couldn't get another pet without their agreement. When she was 7 months along they came back with revised rules in an attempt to compromise. I again let them know that their expectations were not going to fit with my life and they should just find other childcare. Two days after my stepdaughter went back to work, she called and asked if I could keep Cullen the next day. I agreed but made it clear that I was going to provide safe, appropriate care according to my judgement and I wasn't going to deal with complaints or whatever that I was violating their rules because I wanted it very clear that I was not agreeing to any of that. My stepdaughter was okay on the days she picked Cullen up and dropped him off. I felt like she was interrogating me every time she picked him up but it was tolerable but her boyfriend was downright rude. I got to the point where I actually spent Sunday dreading the start of the week because of dealing with both of them but especially his behavior. At minimum he'd pick up Cullen, make a big deal of partially undress him, make at least one snide comment about my cat or if I had any grandchild over besides the 18 month old or if I had cooked or whatever. Then he'd say, I guess we don't have any choice but to put up with this for now. Or I guess you are happy that you won. This went on for 4 months. I spoke to my stepdaughter several times about it and told her that obviously they are very unhappy with how I cared for Cullen and that they should really work on finding something else and that in the meantime he needed to be less vocal about it. It would get better for a day or two and then he'd start again. It all came to a head as Thanksgiving was approaching. He was very verbal about the fact that he didn't want me to keep all my grandchildren over the break. I made it very clear that there would be a couple of days that I had all of them and that they needed to make other arrangements if they had a problem. They didn’t make other arrangements and when he picked Cullen up on the first day that I had all my grands, he was very rude and although nothing happened, everyone was happy, clean, fed, had a great day he said (to Cullen) that he was sorry that they had no choice except to leave him in an unsafe situation to be neglected. I called my stepdaughter that night, relayed to her what was said and told her that she had two weeks to make other arrangements and that she needed to drop off and pick up Cullen during those two weeks and if her boyfriend came to drop him off I would refuse to keep him and if he picked him up I would not keep him again. So things were better only dealing with her. At some point she asked me if I would keep him until January because they found someone but he couldn't start until then. I agreed. She picked Cullen up and dropped him off everything was fine. New Year's Day several people sent me a screenshot of a post her boyfriend made on social media about how thankful he was that they were finally able to leave Cullen without worrying about his safety or him being neglected. He didn't outright name me or accuse me of anything specific but anyone who knows us, knows I was keeping him and the post implied plenty. I was just happy that it was over. Friday she called me and said that their new childcare provider had told her that Cullen wasn't a good fit and that she couldn't bring him back Monday. She asked if I would start keeping him again. I told her that I was sorry for their situation but I really don't feel comfortable keeping him. My husband and stepson both think I should watch Cullen under the agreement that Amanda drop him off and pick him up because they think her boyfriend is the big problem and that I should just do it for Cullen's sake. My stepson also commented that I'd probably be more willing to let it go if it had been a conflict with my daughter's husband. My pension is about $4,000/month plus continuation of my health insurance. That's about 40% of our take home income if that matters. Aitah for refusing to start watching Cullen again?

I was an investigator and i was trained to work dv cases and spot the signs of an abuser. I dont like this one bit. You need to talk with your stepdaughter about her safety. If he does this to you, imagine what he does to her behind closed doors. This man is a narcissist. He is overbearing and demanding. Far too demanding in my opinion for a man who cant even be bothered to put a ring on it before getting a woman pregnant. Especially because he knew damn well he couldnt afford a wife and child to begin with. This is why she still has to work and cant stay home to care for her baby, and why they need you to provide free childcare. There was no other babysitter, he made that up to manipulate you, and i wouldn't doubt that he lied to her about this phantom babysitter who claims a baby is not a \"good fit\". Im worried about your stepdaughter with this man. He obviously baby trapped her and is now using the child to bully everyone. The control he has over the child and mother makes him feel superior. Please have you and your husband sit her down and talk to her about her options to ensure her and her childs safety.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hvebbz/comment/ml0cp6t/","user_commenting":"Friendly-Regret-652","user_url":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Friendly-Regret-652/","date_of_comment":"2025-04-02T11:56:28.214Z","num_upvotes":1,"num_replies":0,"replies":[]},{"comment":"Sorry, but you need to call these assholes out on their deplorable, entitled, gaslighting behavior.

So I ended up in a different Toyota. Appreciate all of you!! I'm looking at purchasing a 2016 Toyota Highlander XLE AWD and after watching some YouTube Videos by the Car Nut, this seems like a solid car but he mentioned that the have some bad oil leaks. Has any one experience this? With the purchase I would be getting a 2 year warranty. My biggest struggle is also paying 20k for a car that already has 100k miles on but it seems like any Toyota I'm looking at has high mileage and in my area I found other 2015-2017s that are only 5-6k cheaper but are all over 150k. Background: My engine blew on my 2014 Crosstrek and I need something reliable and for the most part problem free and I have been wanting a bigger space (3 dogs + expanding our family) and I was originally trying to get a 4 Runner, but those are even more expensive with more miles. So any opinions on this year or if this is a better year to look at would be greatly appreciated. I really am trying to find something this weekend to avoid throwing money away on a rental.

There are ways to mitigate dives. Good positioning, team coordination, peeling, it all matters. But let’s not kid ourselves, most players aren’t in GM. The vast majority are casual, low to mid rank players just trying to have a good time. Btw They’re not voice stacking full teams with synced cooldowns. They’re logging in after work or school, solo queuing, and trying to make the best of what they’ve got. In those environments, dives are a problem. Teams lack the coordination to consistently counter them. DPS players may not react in time. Supports get steamrolled before they even process what’s happening. Telling players to “just get better” ignores the core issue that the experience isn’t fun when a playstyle feels oppressive and you don’t have the tools, or the team to respond effectively. So yes, getting rolled by dive can be a skill issue. But that doesn’t make it a non issue. Acknowledging that something is counterable doesn’t erase the fact that it can also create a miserable experience for the majority of players. Both can be true: • At GM, dive isn’t a huge issue. • At gold, plat, or even diamond? It is. Good design doesn’t just cater to the top 1%, it considers the 99% too. So let’s stop pretending complaints about dive are invalid just because they don’t apply in high level play.

Yes if i have comms and no language barrier 2 people can counter 1 person and even then it takes far more skill for a support to beat panther than vice versa but that's not the case always, at least Spiderman is losing his team up which is gonna be a big nerf but still needs fixes to his uppercut and to remove the automatic web lock on when he hits a cluster, panther needs a full rework and yes i have played him strictly to learn how to outplay him and all i got out of it was Ban him in ranked and go afk in quickplay cause if you ain't cloaknDagger or Loki you ain't living solo.

I can see even a team is making mistakes though. Just played a game and was healing somewhat well but their spiderman was oppressive and at first he was not killing but started to be in the backline 24/7 Pinging and even saying after winning round 1 that he was on me 24/7 nothing clicked in my team’s head to go lets counter him. We had a Bucky and Wanda….which yea do counter him well but they were not killing him despite going positive. They just let him swing all over the map as I’m trying to heal, evade, and ping and he just dominated us. Our tanks also did not counter him (Emma, Groot). So we proceed to lose the 2nd round because what do i see our Bucky and Wanda Do. They go squirrel girl and moon knight. 2 dps that are fun but do not counter dive well.
