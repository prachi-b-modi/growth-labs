(BRUTALLY HONEST PLEASE I BEG OF YOU)","description":"I only have fan art for up-to-date finished drawings. I mostly draw original characters. Anyway, this is super long but I can't make a TLDR without losing important context or making it super long. Looking back, I think I only did art because I thought it was easy and I thought I‚Äôd be some super duper ultra pro by now (I was in elementary school when I thought this, by the way. I stopped thinking this by 8th grade. I thought a ton of other stupid things in elementary school, which is a story for another day, so I really shouldn't have had my hopes so high lol.) Online tutorials never made sense to me, so I thought I‚Äôd be able to wing it myself. This was literally the most obvious sign drawing wasn‚Äôt for me. I can‚Äôt learn things by myself at all and always need someone else teaching me. Looking back, in art classes in elementary AND middle school, I‚Äôd just draw meaningless cutesy stuff. Other kids were making meaningful things for their parents, or just anything that was worthy of hanging it up on the fridge or something. Me? It was just the pink, yellow, bunnies, stars, hearts, anime style girls. Over and over and over again. I moved on from that kawaii stuff, but I can‚Äôt make anything actually meaningful still. To me, it‚Äôs still the cutesy stuff but in a different form. And my family's getting tired of it. Only my little cousins like it. On 2023, I had an art class. I thought I was okay until that. The ‚Äúgood at art‚Äú students were given genuine compliments and specific, honest advice from teachers and classmates. The ‚Äúbad at art‚Äù students were given empty compliments and no advice to not hurt their feelings. I was one of the only ‚Äúbad at art‚Äù students. They‚Äôd all say ‚ÄùNothing! It‚Äôs great!‚Äù when I‚Äôd ask for improvement. But if you look at what I drew, there‚Äôs TONS of mistakes, and you‚Äôd believe me if you saw them. Whether the assignment told us to do realism or stylized, there'd always be a trillion mistakes. If there really was nothing to say, I‚Äôd be some ultimate professional working for a huge company. But I'm obviously not lol. I didn't even sign up for AP Studio Art because it'll be the exact same experience except 50x the work load. (Funny little story. One time, I went to a tour of an art school FOR FUN. They had a 2D animation major, and I knew I wouldn't get in, so I never applied and just went there in case I was able to in the future. It actually was really fun. One time, my parents were asking one of the staff about financial aid, and they were getting along pretty well. The guy asked me \"Can I see how you draw?\" And I was like \"Um, okay!\" And I showed him a drawing and he got that \"trying too hard to be nice\" smile and he was all \"Oh nice. üòê\" and THE AWKWARDNESS WAS REAL!! It was sad that I wasn't that good but also really funny, even now.) People only like my \"drawings\" because they like me. If they hated me, they would hate my drawings. I wanted to be that level where people say \"I hate her, but at least she draws great!\" But I'm at that level where if people just woke up and decided to hate me, they'd say \"Oh, I never liked it anyway! Let's all go and insult it!!\" If I had to admit, I don‚Äôt even call it ‚Äúart‚Äù. Even calling it ‚Äúdrawings‚Äù feels wrong. Doodles. Yeah, doodles is more like it. I mean, I never felt passionate about it. Like \"aRt Is My PaSsIoN aNd My SoUl AnD mY dEsTiNy--\" I just liked using markers and crayons and gel pens to draw cute stuff as a kid and my family hyped me up to think I'd become this super expert anime artist making my own game/anime. People are so adamant about me not quitting, but I‚Äôm always met with unenthusiasm when I actually make something. I'm not comparing myself to social media artists or professionals (which is stupid because they have 983,729,927,145,246,689 years of experience and I'm only 18). I‚Äôve only come to the conclusion by myself. And I‚Äôve heard all the sayings. ‚ÄúArt is subjective! There‚Äôs no such thing as bad art!‚Äù ‚ÄúArt is art, even if it‚Äôs bad!‚Äù ‚ÄúAt least it‚Äôs not stolen or AI!‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay to make bad art! You don‚Äôt have to be the best at anything!‚Äù But they don‚Äôt help. I don‚Äôt know how exactly to put it to words but the best I can describe it is like telling someone \"Live Laugh Love\" when they're sad or whatever. (Also it's like they think it's the same old story of a beginner artist comparing themself to social media and experts and they have these eeeevil parents who think art isn't a real career when I'm a grown ahh woman who's had 15 years to learn to draw properly but didn't, and finally facing a reality check but my family keeps saying \"You should be an artist!\" all the time.) I feel empty when drawing and I‚Äôd make excuses to myself about why I don‚Äôt wanna study anatomy or fundamentals. I know now it's because I know it'd make me more miserable when even doodling is hard. And again, I can't learn anything by myself. But they don‚Äôt want me to quit. And as painful as it is to draw, I feel like I‚Äôd have nothing if I quit. I already suck at drawing, but other than that, I literally can‚Äôt do anything else. Not as a hobby, not as a college major, not as a job, not even for fun, nothing. And if I can't draw, I just scroll, and I HATE scrolling. And I'd be one of those people whose only hobbies is playing games and media consumption. And that'll make me a boring, low-life geek. And I'm not a boring, low-life geek. So it's basically like this: If I don't draw, I'll be a huge nobody. But if I do, I‚Äôll feel miserable all the time! And I can‚Äôt do anything else for my future. The only things I CAN do are mundane, easily replaceable things that pay 3¬¢ each century. (And before anyone asks, I'm not neurodivergent. Several tests resulted that I was neurotypical. I'm just really, unbelieveably dumb. Like, to the point it makes people angry.) And I REFUSE to be a housewife. I wanna work doing things I love and get trinkets. But I don't got any skills worthy of trinket-purchasing-money soooooooo... ;________;","num_comments":319,"date_posted":"2025-04-14T02:44:46.059Z","community_name":"Artadvice","num_upvotes":615,"photos":["https://preview.redd.it/should-i-quit-brutally-honest-please-i-beg-of-you-v0-hcma3tzappue1.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=e3b8b335ea8b570ab445bb9342cf34ed8b3ed21c","https://preview.redd.it/should-i-quit-brutally-honest-please-i-beg-of-you-v0-q15agtzappue1.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=204d304e92bdcee49d64df29a779d61f939488b0","https://preview.redd.it/should-i-quit-brutally-honest-please-i-beg-of-you-v0-jwdumszappue1.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=82d38b913dda50eb8cbf7930adc93d274c905313"],"videos":null,"tag":null,"related_posts":[{"community":"exjw","community_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/1jtagar/i_am_quietly_sitting_at_the_kh_as_a_deleted_elder/","title":"I am quietly sitting at the KH as a deleted elder for having kids goto college while pervert with \"don't approach minors\" restriction is commenting like a great example.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/1jtagar/i_am_quietly_sitting_at_the_kh_as_a_deleted_elder/","thumbnail":null,"num_upvotes":"794","num_comments":242},{"community":"electricians","community_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/electricians/comments/1m3gd8q/feeling_like_i_want_to_quit/","title":"Feeling like I want to quit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/electricians/comments/1m3gd8q/feeling_like_i_want_to_quit/","thumbnail":null,"num_upvotes":"59","num_comments":85},{"community":"solodevelopment","community_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/SoloDevelopment/comments/1kru0u5/im_not_quitting_my_job/","title":"I'm not quitting my job","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/SoloDevelopment/comments/1kru0u5/im_not_quitting_my_job/","thumbnail":null,"num_upvotes":"269","num_comments":31},{"community":"dishwashers","community_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/dishwashers/comments/1lfqz0o/i_wanna_quit_already/","title":"i wanna quit already","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/dishwashers/comments/1lfqz0o/i_wanna_quit_already/","thumbnail":null,"num_upvotes":"148","num_comments":50},{"community":"managedbynarcissists","community_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ManagedByNarcissists/comments/1i9sz9y/i_quit/","title":"I quit!!!","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ManagedByNarcissists/comments/1i9sz9y/i_quit/","thumbnail":null,"num_upvotes":"247","num_comments":31},{"community":"hatemyjob","community_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/hatemyjob/comments/1m4xr3e/want_to_quit_without_anything_lined_up_ive_had/","title":"Want to quit without anything lined up...

Try sir down your parents and tell them that their expectations are unrealistic but thank them for being supportive. And route 3 branches from that. Be a hobby artist but try to grow a social media.

You are kind of fishing for compliments, which is not a malicious thing to do, you are just very insecure and scared of being unlikeable. You switch between \"I hate making art, I hate drawing\" and \"I enjoy using artist supplies, I really love that drawing I made\" in a heartbeat - depending on what fits the narrative to get the most empathy and compliments from commenters. I don't blame you for that. Humans are social and very desperate to fit in, and when we never learn that just existing is usually enough to fit in, we start making one thing our entire personality. That's what you're experiencing. You have been trying to be \"the art kid\" to be recognized and admired by others. Now you are stuck there because you can't risk being \"invisible\" when you drop your \"art kid\" persona. You doing art doesn't make people like you more, or makes them magically super interested in you. You have yourself convinced that doing art is the only way to \"be seen\" and get compliments. This is not true. You are capable of many things, you are just too scared to try and find out. People are not worthless because they are not insanely good at anything. If you are a decent, pleasant person to be around, people will like you. Therapy may help you to let go of the fear of being not liked, and helps you build confidence in who you are. There's probably tons of self-help books and videos on YouTube to get started if therapy is hard to get where you live!","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Artadvice/comments/1jyoq1v/comment/mnwbwap/","user_commenting":"Asealas","user_url":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Asealas/","date_of_comment":"2025-04-19T08:34:17.819Z","num_upvotes":2,"num_replies":1,"replies":[{"user_replying":"[deleted]","user_url":"https://www.reddit.com/svc/shreddit/comments/r/Artadvice/undefined","reply":"Oh I just wanted to know if I actually should stop.

You're trying to figure out if and why you have a passion and that's a scary question to ask. There's some things that stick out to me in your story. It seems like you really want your art to be more than the doodles you think they are now. In that art class you took, you saw something apparently more meaningful in other students. Was it the fact that they got compliments? Constructive feedback? Or their work itself? Answering that may be hard, but try, if you can. If you could pick any dream project, would you still work on it if no one was there to compliment it? Or would you prefer to find out what kind of work gets complimented and start making that (just assume you're capable of it, for sake of argument)? Also it really sucks to get shallow feedback, so I sympathise there. I don't know how this class was organised, but I guess a lot of good feedback depends on people having some context to your work. This post is good context, because it helps me see your current work as something you want to grow from, or out of, towards something new perhaps. On an individual piece, in isolation, it can be hard to give feedback, because it's hard to just invent what you were going for visually, or what you're trying to say with a piece. Have you tried any work more towards that 'je ne sais quoi' meaningfulness you want? What sort of project should you work on to be proud of yourself? If you shared something daring in that direction, you'd give people a lot to reflect on. But if you call your own work 'just doodles' then it's difficult to say more than that it's really cute.

While I understand why Wildlands is the better game because of the story, the rest is better or equal in Breakpoint. I‚Äôve immersed myself in Auroa more than my first playthrough, so now in my head it makes sense that there‚Äôs not much civvies going about their day in the more rural or less populated area of the Archipelago. Sure it‚Äôs annoying finding patrol every 45 seconds and that no matter the amount of sentinel and wolf you killed their numbers are limitless but it‚Äôs still a damn good game when you make the experience yourself. I walk most of the time from objective to objective, do more of the factions side missions (green dot ones), keep my hud to a minimum (only loot because I have children and I‚Äôm tired to find things lol). I change outfit only in Erewhon or Bivouacs, and the only time I use chopper or land vehicules is when the objective is farther than 5km, other wise I explore and you‚Äôd be surprise at the level of details the game can offer. Story sucks ass but I get what they were trying to do, and launch day was a disaster but it‚Äôs now a great game with all the improvements made over the years. I wish they would implements dedicated mods for console players like Skyrim or Baldur‚Äôs Gate did but I‚Äôm pretty much happy with the customization features. I‚Äôm truly tired of hearing or reading people complaining about a game that came out nearly 6 years ago, it‚Äôs not perfect and it‚Äôs far from it but it stays a damn good game in my mind and I love roaming around Auroa from morning to night raising hell amongst the ennemies forces. Sure it looks more air soft than real life but god damn, how many of us here are in any branches of Special Forces from their country? I‚Äôm fucking far as fuck of being a JTF2 operator or even a CSOR one lol. I‚Äôm glad this game exist simply for the fact that they butchered and tortured R6 Siege and its not the level of fun I had growing up with Raven Shield or Athena Sword. Well that was my 2 cents.

Most issues arise due to shipping, some carrier issues and sometimes seller issues (packing the plants up days before shipping and despite 2 day shipping, the plants arrive bone dry and not alive). In this particular order, I won mystery plants in a game. One of which was a monstera albo rooted cutting. You can find these for around $30 now and I paid $25 or so. There were 5 total plants. This seller really didn‚Äôt package well. The plants were all in perlite (small volcanic rock) and simply wrapped in newspaper without securing the perlite at all. There was perlite all over the box and most roots had fully dried out due to being in perlite and newspaper. Newspaper was used to pad the areas around the plant bundles and I believe there was a little polyfill around the plants. I paid a total of $40 in shipping costs and actual shipping cost was ~$25 not including the shipping material. I didn‚Äôt message the seller directly because a broken leaf isn‚Äôt something I‚Äôd expect a refund for. I left him a 4 star review, which I thought was generous given the amount of movement the plants went through in shipping which is ultimately the seller‚Äôs responsibility to try to minimize. To me, it was obvious that tge damage to the cutting happened due to poor packing thus a 4* review. I originally was going to do a 3* review but bumped it up because I know a lot of sellers on there are one man shops and in the end everything was alive on arrival. I have ordered probably 10+ plant orders online and am aware of normal shipping stress (yellow leaves, sometimes leaves drop, etc). The seller reached out to me in the message above and I am just not sure if I am overreacting? Is a 4 star review really that bad? AITA for expecting a $40 shipping charge insures proper packing that limits damage? Also for those who use Palmstreet, there are some tissue culture plants from jumanjijon in the background but this post is NOT him. His shipping is ü§åüèª TLDR received a broken cutting, left seller a 4* review and received this message in response to that.

They do a backwards job, then get offended when you don‚Äôt leave a glowing review. I had this happen countless times (I shop a lot and I like buying sustainable / local / small etc). For example, I once paid ¬£40 for a hand painted wood + cotton fan that arrived deformed, stinky and looking like it was painted by a child - nothing like the photos. I messaged to talk about this and seller went mental - literally speed spamming with angry caps lock messages while I am typing a single response, cursing me, telling me I don‚Äôt appreciate good quality when I see it, etc. Bottom line, as frustrating as it is, this is now part of our modern age where ANYONE can sell ANYTHING on the internet. A large, established company would never behave like that. For this reason if I have a choice, I buy from reliable sources. And to answer your question, you did nothing wrong. I am sorry you had to go through this, it was absolutely uncalled for. Personally I would edit the review to 1 star and mention seller‚Äôs behaviour. Reviews are there to help other potential buyers!

I caused 10 mil casualties and it feels like I didn't do anything. Mod creator created artificial difficulty by basically giving spanish civil war debuffs to every state which makes it impossible to attack. As you can see in picture \"guerilla operations\" gives you -75% attack, deep snow gives -75% and mountainous terrain gives another -100% attack, so you basically can't attack till spring/summer( I know about planning offensives). Also you basically can't create collabs cause they take 290 days and for every collab you do, you only get 1% surrender limit, while china has 3% surrender limit. Also mod developer deleted all supply hubs inside china and only supply you can get are coastal areas with ports. Forget building supply hubs because they take 150+ days. Also china gets -75% supply consumption national spirit so they are never bothered by it. My question is why create such a cool mod only to ruin it by making it basically impossible to play any other way other than playing meta that develoer wants you to? I played black ice and total war mods and had a blast and even though they were not easy mods, they still felt very rewarding and fair while world ablaze is doing everything it can to suck the fun and life out of you by all means necessary.

Hell, why do you think mods like kaiserreich are so popular even for people who don‚Äôt care fir Germany. Mechanics that railroad history is only fun because it‚Äôs meant to be broken. When you learn the game mechanics and break from that railroad and achieve something that IRL country couldn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs supposed to be rewarding and the game rewards you for it. But these mods are dead set at punishing you for daring to want to go off script. Plus I think half these mods are either lazy or the modders don‚Äôt actually understand why things happened, hence why they can‚Äôt even come up with interesting mechanics. Japan suffered setbacks in China because the war expanded far beyond their scope, their army was taking significant losses (not as significant as the Chinese, but still), and logistics was difficult when there‚Äôs no infrastructure.

Some can be quite great, but these examples are just bad, imo. In the 2021 Mortal Kombat movie, instead of each character just having their own unique powers and abilities like the games, the movie has to establish that everyone powers come from the same place: \"arcana\" energy that comes from within. This just makes the universe feel super small and less varied for me. I could at least tolerate it if only \"magical\" characters like Shang Tsung, Liu Kang, and Shao Kahn only used arcana, but it's especially stupid when characters whose powers come from advanced technology like Kano and Jax now get their abilities from arcana. It's such a pointless change. Another Mortal Kombat example is Sindel randomly being revealed to be evil in Mortal Kombat 11 and to have been the one who murdered Jerrod and willfully ally with Shao Kahn. This literally makes all of her characterization and dialogue from and about Sindel throughout not only MK9 and MKX but also all other past MK games completely nonsensical. It ultimately just boils down to being bad, cheap shock value, and even Netherrealm got the hint as Sindel was back to be completely good in MK1. Finally, the Taken in Destiny are an army of various beings who were pulled into an alternate dimension covered completely in Darkness (esoteric energy) where they were mutated and stripped of all their fears, worries, and weaknesses. The Taken often occasionally jitter and shake during combat, and lore cards in the original Destiny game implied that this was from ecstasy as the people who were Taken truly enjoyed having all of their flaws and worries removed and feeling powerful. However, in Destiny 2, Awoken Techeuns (Basically Space Elf Mages) were freed from being Taken, and they said it was a living agony for them, so the detail of people enjoying being Taken might have been retconned. This sucks as it removes the genuine unique creepiness of the Taken to just make them into another \"they are constantly suffering\" trope that is way more common instead of them enjoying being monsters. However, this may not be the case since the Techeuns are again Space Elf Mages, so their abilities might have made the Taken experience different for them compared to the regular Taken enemies in the game.

I upgraded mine and my partner‚Äôs tickets last minute as a surprise. This was my first time flying business on any airline and I had such a strange experience. Now I know KLM does not have the most impressive business class product out there, but we were still really excited for all the bells and whistles. To start, when we got seated, we didn‚Äôt get offered a welcome drink, despite other passengers around us getting offered. We thought it was a bit strange but maybe since we came from a tight connection, they didn‚Äôt notice us board. Whatever. After take off, the FAs came to take drink and dinner orders. When the FA got to my seat, she was fiddling with the drink cart and didn‚Äôt say anything to me, so I waited until she was ready. She just stared at me and I asked for a ginger ale. Then she left and went to my partner‚Äôs seat behind me. I heard her greet him, ask what he would like to drink, and take his dinner order. I was very confused because she didn‚Äôt speak to me at all. After a couple of minutes of seeing it she would come back, I pressed the call button. It took about 10 minutes for an FA to come by and I told her that no one took my meal order. She said someone will come by shortly. I got up and went to the restroom. When I opened the restroom door to leave, the original FA was standing there and asked me if I felt okay. I was confused but said yes I‚Äôm fine and she said ‚ÄúOh okay I thought you weren‚Äôt feeling well.‚Äù I‚Äôm not sure what would have led her to think this other than the fact that I ordered a ginger ale. Anyway, got back to my seat and got a delayed meal service. And the food sucked which I‚Äôve seen regular complaints of. I actually would have rather had the economy cheese sandwich, it was so bad. The rest of the in flight service was super mediocre, every time they came by it seemed like they were in such a rush, I had about .25 second to select my Delft house. I also purchased a wifi pass that didn‚Äôt work for 75% of the flight. I know it‚Äôs stupid to complain about a fancy flight but I‚Äôm just a regular gal who used her hard earned money to try something fun and it was a major let down!

Felt that it might be useful for a larger student base. Q1. Is B.A.(P) really a terrible choice, as many people suggest? It really depends on the student, tbh. I personally wanted B.A.(P) because having a multidisciplinary approach aligns with my professional goals. And with the introduction of the four-year programme, I'll have Hons. on paper anyways, along with the added benefit of multidisciplinary knowledge. Hons. courses are considered 'better' because historically, they've had higher cut-offs. You obviously don't go to depth to the same extent in Prog. courses as you do in Hons. courses, but apart from that there really is no difference. Also, the faculty doesn't 'teach' you when you're in college. They're better understood as guides, and it's upon the student to extract as much knowledge from them as they can. Q2. Is the faculty worse in B.A.(Prog.) than in Hons.? The faculty is the same for the Prog. and Hons. courses. Hence, even a B.A.(P) student who is academically inclined enough can end up having a knowledge base that's comparable to an Hons. student. Q3. What about the crowd? I've been told it's bad in B.A.(P). Well, the crowd is very college-dependent. But at the end of the day, you don't need a big crowd to find good people. Good people are everywhere. And the people who think that B.A.(P) crowd sucks come from a shallow mindset where the only criteria for judgement is marks. Q4. So, is Hons. in an off-campus college better than B.A.(P) in a decent college? As for the people who've told you that Hons. in off-campus colleges is better than Prog., just ask them for logical reasons apart from \"Prog sucks\". In my opinion, there aren't any. The inferiority and superiority complexes will remain ingrained and will continue to get perpetuated as long as the students studying these courses don't take pride in themselves. One point which you might find reiterated time and again is that \"Prog. se placement nahi hoti\". Well, tbh campus placement kisi bhi B.A. course se easily nahi hoti. It's your knowledge and skill base that matters (apart from courses like B.Com. etc.). So, for the placement part, being in B.A.(P) in a college that has a better placement cell is obviously better than being in an Hons. course in a college where the placement cell doesn't even attract major players. Q5. Does B.A.(P) affect placement opportunities significantly? Not really. As said above, campus placements don't come easy for any B.A. course. (Read: exclude commerce courses). If placements are important to you, then a better placement cell matters more than your course title being 'Hons.'. Q6. Do I get an Hons. degree if I complete four years in B.A.(P)? Yes. If you do 4 years, then on paper your degree is equivalent to Hons. anyways. So, as long as you're willing to put in the work, I don't see this B.A.(P) stuff as problematic. Just make sure it doesn't impact your career trajectory and goals. Q7. Was B.A.(P) your first choice or a compromise? For me, B.A.(P) was an active choice. I could've gotten a better college with a better preference list. Perhaps even North Campus. But I would've still opted for Prog. over Hons. simply because it aligned better with my goals. Q8. Are people in Hons. courses more intelligent? Will the people in Hons. courses generally be more 'intelligent'? Sure. But they'll be more intelligent not in absolute terms, but in volume. i.e., to say 7 out of 10 people would've scored good marks. Will there be 'intelligent' people in Prog.? Absolutely. But the number might drop down to 2/10. But the level of 'intelligence' of these 2 would be at par with all the other 'intelligent', 'better' Hons. students throughout the college, across the courses. Because when it comes to general intelligence, it really is not determined by course or marks, but rather a much larger superstructure entangled with the intricacies of personal factors. And in that respect, almost all the students come under the same umbrella. Q9. Are B.A.(P) students more fun and chill to be around? Honestly, the point that Prog. people are in general more fun and chill to be around is also a vast generalisation. Lol, in fact, most of the people from my college, even the ones from Hons. courses, even from science, consider me to be a very 'serious' student. So, yeah, people come in all shapes and forms in every course. Q10. What about friends and socialising if everyone has different majors and minors? You won't surround yourself with just the people from your course. In that respect, Prog. courses are a little different. Due to different majors and minors and further division of students into sections, you won't be in touch with the same people even from your own combination for longer stretches of the day. So, it is you who'll choose the people you want to be around with. And at the end of the day, they can be from any course. Q11. Where do you actually make lasting connections in DU? You'll form better and more lasting connections with people from the societies which you choose to join. So, just do that carefully and don't tolerate toxicity masked as ethics and work culture. Q12. What about the fear-mongering that B.A.(P) won‚Äôt get an Hons. tag even after 4 years? The fear mongering is basically pointless. This is literally the first batch of NEP. And even if you don't put trust in the system, which is very understandable, you can still count on written guidelines because they have to be implemented by default. Otherwise, the reputation of the university gets tarnished and that impacts everything from rankings to funding. Q13. Will I hate the four years I end up spending in Delhi University and B.A. (P)? I can't say that you won't hate your 4 years here. Because that is a very personal experience. You can love the whole thing and you can hate it too. But something that I can assure you of, is the fact that B.A.(P) won't be the sole reason for you hating or loving your overall experience. DU is much more than the course you're pursuing. It's more so about opportunities and connections. And you can make them irrespective of your course. Q14. Who are you and why are you defending B.A. (P)? Keeping just the relevant stuff here, not including my involvement in societies etc. (You can ask about that separately if you have any doubts). I'm a B.A. (P) student from the first CUET batch, in an off campus college, who scored 710/800. and ended up in my current college due to a preference list fiasco. I surely would've landed a better college but my preference always was Prog. > Hons. as I answered in the beginning of this list of Questions and Answers. And even now, moving into the 4th year, I don't regret my choice for this course (College ke liye regret hona, na hona, alag baat hai. Uske liye ek aur lamba answer likha tha pehle kisi ke DMs mein ya kisi comment mein).

Anyhow, here it is. I was switching from PCB to Humanities (intentional stream change due to shifting interests and natural aptitude for humanities), and was extremely gullible/ perhaps even ignorant at that time. I relied completely on a senior from school for guidance as she was already in DU. At that time, I didn't know at all about the varying rankings of various DU colleges. Didn't even have the concept of North-South Campus as during my 11th and 12th, I was focused on the courses in the medical field and my general awareness was kind of at an all time low. I attempted CUET just to give it a try, without any specific preparation for it and ended up scoring quite fine. So, anyhow that senior said that her college is quite good and she's had several opportunities to grow there. And I basically believed her completely and put that college at the top of my preference list. Got the same college in the first round, but couldn't really upgrade as it was already at the top of my list. In hindsight, it does seem stupid. But I didn't really know better and the senior was amongst the best students back in school.

First, my pants are the wrong size and the stylist didn't listen to the cut I wanted. I would try them on but they are too small of size so I can't tell if they would be flattering. The sweater is fine but not my style. I asked for no white clothing. It is also about to be summer so I don't think it is season appropriate (I live in Texas.) In my opinion it is frumpy. My other concern is that the outfit doesn't match at all. It feels like someone just picked out random mismatched items that didn't cater to anything I requested and aren't even the correct size. It took 2 weeks to be picked out and I feel like no time or effort was spent on this. The outfit provided is extremely ugly together. I was under the impression it would be more than 2 articles of clothing but I could have overlooked that. I can't even make an outfit out of these. They blatantly do not match. I have used other boxes in the past and this is not one of the better ones. I needed new clothes because I have gained weight and felt self conscious. I am not great at styling so I wanted assistance putting an outfit together. (I suppose some people would make this look good but not me.) This was supposed to be a confidence boost but I am left discouraged and do not have any new clothes at the end of the day. I would try an exchange, but am worried it will have the same results. I can't request a refund on the page since it does not work. Tbh this felt like I went to Ross with a blindfold on and grabbed random stuff from the clearance section.

Was debating on buying a Duke 250 or an Xtreme 250R. Although I know the cons of a new engine, I finally settled on the Xtreme considering the huge price gap. I have visited the Premia showroom four times as of today. The first time, I had called the showroom before going so that I wouldn't have to face any difficulties during the test drive. They said everything was fine. After arriving at the showroom, I had to wait almost 1.5 hours for them to tell me that the key was missing. Second time I went in, I had to wait again, but I got the test drive. The vehicle was subpar because of abuse of the test drive unit. Third time, I took my dad, and we had to wait 1.5 hours again for a salesman to accompany us. The experience was most irritating ever; every 10 minutes, the guy would leave and then come back. Fourth time, which is today, I went to finally book the bike. I went early in the morning so there wouldn't be any crowd, and we would get priority and wouldn't have to wait. The same story happened this time as well; I had to wait 45 minutes. Finally, I decided to tell them about their bad service and walk out of there. My dad was obviously pissed because of their attitude. Left the showroom, went straight to the ktm dealership and booked 250 duke because of shear amount of hospitality the showed us.(dad hates ktm btw) Happy that I dont have to deal with hero anymore. And well done to ktm for loosing a customer.

Hero is not sending the units, the sales team is going crazy over high demand. they are not trained to handle this its literally visible. Somewhat they are pushing customers away. Once the demand declines they will be back on track. Btw even i had just two machines in mind 250r and duke 250, It was a very close call for me. Which hero premia showroom was this ?

She‚Äôs a chihuahua that i‚Äôve had since she was born. I was 19 when my now fianc√©e gave her to me, and shortly after that my fianc√©e moved in with me at my dad‚Äôs house because of some family issues. Eventually the landlord of my dads house decided to sell the house and it basically up rooted our lives. Me and my fianc√©e were kind of stuck with no choice but to stop school and look for a job and a place to live, be adults now so suddenly. Long story short we ended up living in so many different places (all good) over the next year and Roxy was always there with us. A year later we had more stable work and a place to live and Roxy‚Äôs parents ended up having another litter. We took two more in. 3 sisters, me, and my fianc√©e. From 20 years old to 26 years old now it was legit us 5 always, it was an actual family. We moved multiple times and switched careers, and actually became adults along this journey, all 5 of us. Her nickname was rock, and i never realized how perfect that nickname was until today because she was literally our rock. She was one of those dogs that had so many different emotions that made her feel so human like. She could basically talk to you with her eyes and other actions. Cry when i kissed her mom because she wanted to be a part of the kiss, or bark and jump at us when we pretended to play with each other with out her. She absolutely loved just listening to me and my fianc√©e talk, it comforted her all the time. She would just stare at us and watch us talk to each other, so she always was a part of the conversation and i mean every day all the time. My brother would visit us once in a while and he was living there at my dad‚Äôs house in the beginning so she grew up with him too. But she absolutely loved him, almost more than me sometimes i think (which i love). She knew his name and would get excited if i told her he was coming. She would cry and cry when he got there begging to be carried and then never leave his side. When it was time to go, if he started putting his shoes on she would cry and cry telling him to stay a little longer. She was so impactful to all of us and was truly all of our soul dog. What had happened to her was last thursday she started acting sluggish and breathing really hard. We took her to the vet the next day which made her freak out some more which lead to coughing fits and we found out she has a bad heart murmur, and her heart had already expanded. She was actively in CHF. We got medicine for her heart and medicine for the fluid in her lungs. Over the next few days she was better breathing wise, but lost her appetite. By sunday it went from little food to absolutely none and at this point she would really only have random 5 minute energy boosts to walk around outside go pee and bark. After that it was really just sleeping and drinking water, she didn‚Äôt have any fainting episodes or coughing anymore. Monday we checked back in and euthanasia was already suggested but i couldn‚Äôt do it, felt too sudden. I asked the vet if i could have something to help her eat more because i initially felt that she was so weak because of their being no nutrients in her body. They gave me entyce which i did try. From monday to wednesday i tried so many different things, and i got her to eat a couple bites here and there. But wednesday - thursday it was absolutely no food in her system. She also started shivering but felt warm, i know it‚Äôs possible it was the empty stomach and medicine making her feel worse and that‚Äôs what makes it so difficult to try and understand when she‚Äôs ready to go. But Thursday we decided it was time and the vet agreed. The build up to all of this since Monday was honestly the hardest part. I learned now that it‚Äôs called anticipatory grief. Once the time came we said our goodbyes and were with her while they put her to sleep. The moments it was happening i actually realized that i feel better for her now where as before it was a mix of stress, worry for her, and anticipatory grief. I didn‚Äôt cry when it was happening i was just there for her, my fianc√©e, and my brother. But after I truly felt it was the right decision, the stress and worry for her is gone and i know she‚Äôs resting so well. Now it‚Äôs just grieving. It‚Äôs only 12 hours later and i woke up in the middle of the night crying because i miss her too much. But i find peace knowing that the pain is only with me and she‚Äôs peaceful now. So i hope anyone reading this knows that the build up of it all was so hard, but after it was done there is a sense of peace knowing that they‚Äôre okay. i‚Äôm glad she is resting well and i can still feel her. Specifically with others having a pet diagnosed with CHF, know that you are being strong for yourself and strong for them when it‚Äôs time to make that decision. I think it was possible to take her somewhere else and get a different evaluation or go through more aggressive care to get her back to normal for a while, but there was no cure for the murmur and expanded heart regardless. We could‚Äôve done all of that, gone back to our normal routine and weeks later we could‚Äôve had the sad experience of finding her at home knowing she experienced the worst death possible without us there. But, as we go through the next couple days and weeks learning to be without her i was just hoping that someone can maybe share their story or say what has helped them keep going. Because i do feel like a part of me is empty, and things have just a little less meaning than they did before. I get stuck thinking about the times when it was just us 5 going through our journey and wish that i could pick any one of those days and live it over and over for ever.

After many tiresome hours finally finished it and started mirage... First of all the worst thing bout mirage...CATS CAN BE KILLED...LIKE WHY? Anyways Right off the bat it's so refreshing experiencing the colourful world or mirage compared to the doom and gloom of Valhalla...the graphics look so crisp on mirage even though the character models are the same old bad ubi models... What Ubisoft Bordeaux achieved with the gameplay of mirage is nothing short of amazing...they took the horrendous experience of Valhalla and turned into something great.. made me feel like the good ol' days of AC.. from how they slowed everything down and made you appreciate the small nuances of basims animations like how he opens the barred doors. However simple they made the parkour it works and feels the best in this new era of AC...basim feels light and heavy at times and Baghdad is made into the perfect playground interconnected to give you a decent parkour experience... And thank god for HOLD TO SPRINT!!!! Wtf were they thinking with Valhalla.. The main draw for mirage..the stealth..best since syndicate...the implementation of all the tools and their perks gives you so many opportunities and helps you be imaginative and get kills in fashion... I love the notoriety system.. it incentivises you to keep it down to avoid guards on rooftops and those elite guards that disrupt your stealth runs... The new eagle vision looks good but I would've like to have the pulse system too from Valhalla.. bringing back eavesdropping made have you some nostalgia of the old AC...social stealth was quite fun to take advantage of..I liked how they kinda of balanced it by making you have to follow them instead of them following you... And now we come to Assassin's focus..not loved by many but I have to say it was fun to use at times but they could've made it like the fear takedowns from Arkham knight.. The cons for me would definitely be the combat.. it could be a bit more fleshed out since it sucks to have to go into combat when you fail at stealth...in previous games I used to love to be able to maw down everyone when I failed cause of some janky Stealth mechanics... I can't understand ubi's obsession with bad models during cutscenes.. the last time characters looked decent was in origins and ever since then they feel like lifeless dolls.. The story is a bit short and there could've been much more to it.. especially with the modern day.. basims motivation to join the brotherhood seem rushed...he was a nice protag though.. I wasn't quite sure bout the compass on this map and old AC style...maybe the mini map would've been much better on mirage but would like your opinion on it.. Overall this is the best AC ubi has rolled out in years and props to Bordeaux for their hard work.. hope shadows is even better and they don't fumble it this time..it would be amazing to merge the old and new ac together and get a solid AAA title that is beloved by all.

The best for you is the one you enjoy the most. For me, I would have done the equivalent of dumping this down the drain after a first sip.

A girl who had been a bully to my friend and actually apologized for it cried. Had he been bullied by others in school? Sure. But no more than a lot of the rest of us were. Were people mean to me because I was odd and became obsessed and fixated on ‚Äúnerd shit‚Äù? God yes. Constantly. Some kid kicked me to the ground in 5th grade and then other kids laughed about it. But I also found my people. The other neurodivergents who were also obsessed with nerd shit. My graduating class had over 600 people in it.

I loved the work. I loved physically manipulating the medium and building something. I cannot draw worth a damm but I can sculpt pretty well. And I despised that class. Because of the teacher, who was a typical fluffy art school teacher. She wore tie dye. She spoke softly. She called her room ‚Äúthe sanctuary‚Äù. We called her Airy Fairy but she seemed pretty nice. And any of the kids who were neurodivergent were shuffled off to one table and ignored. Treated like they had a contagious disease. I, as a high functioning autistic, basically ignored that. And she let it go. For a bit. Then one day I found that I had gotten placed in my own isolated little table off to the side. To ‚Äúhelp you concentrate dear‚Äù. I fought it of course. Because‚Ä¶ well. I knew how to do this. I had to interact or I‚Äôd never learn how to. I had to learn these skills or i‚Äôd never be able to function outside of my little bubble. I‚Äôd discussed this with my parents. I was proud of being able to function in normal society. The worst part is that I‚Äôm pretty sure she actually thought she was helping. She actually thought that isolating me off to the side so I could be in my own little world would be helpful. Less disruptive. Nice and calm. And that was the standard operating procedure for the whole school. Shuffle all the neurodivergent kids off to the little room off to the side and then ignore them. I looked inside, it was basically a preschool classroom. the Paraprofessionals (people actually trained to work with autistic kids) tried, and tried hard but‚Ä¶ they were limited by the environment. I‚Äôm pretty sure that some of those kids could have functioned in normal classes. Some of them definitely needed the altered environment but there were two I talked to who were perfectly cogent even if a bit shy. But no one knew how to deal with kids who weren‚Äôt neurotypical and so they were shuffled off, out of sight and out of mind. One of them participated in figure skating in the Special Olympics, and he got a brief assembly. I don‚Äôt think it was malice. I just think they had no idea how to deal with us and most kids don‚Äôt fight to be involved in difficult and stressful social situations of normal classes. And they don‚Äôt have parents who fight for them either. It‚Äôs not always malice.

I was born and raised in Maine and have lived here my whole life. Born and raised in York County, currently living in Cumberland county. I am 27F. I have multiple degrees and certificates in the Human Services field. I work full time and have my own apartment. Stating this before anyone comes in here accusing me of being something I'm not. I am educated and a fully functioning member of society and do not rely on any social benefits (not like that would be a bad thing if I was though). I have recently come across a Tiktoker, who is from Montana I believe it is, who has been making posts telling Mainers we have basically no right to be upset about our housing crisis and the INSANE influx of tourism our state has seen within the past 5 years. The comments are diabolical, filled with out-of-staters laughing at us and responding to our comments crying out in despair about our housing crisis that is STRANGLING US with negativity and telling us we need to just suck it up and that \"we wouldn't survive without them\"... I think we survive pretty fuckin well the whole other 80% of the year when these jackholes aren't here. There are transplants in the comments, replying to locals explaining the very real struggles we face, accusing us of all being crackheads and other derogatory terms. There are self-proclaimed \"summer vacationers\" saying they fully avoid Mainers because we're all \"so miserable\". Massholes commenting about all the bad experiences they have had with Mainers (wonder why they were acting that way towards themüôÑ). People from out of state claiming they own businesses here yet calling all of us drug addicts??? This post is to ask- WHY COME HERE IF ALL YOU ARE GOING TO DO IS TAKE OUR HOMES, SHIT ON US AND CALL US OUT OUR NAMES, WRECK OUR BEACHES, AND DISRESPECT US???? WE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE YOUR SUMMER SO ENJOYABLE YET THERE IS ABSOLUTELY ZERO RESPECT FOR US OR OUR LAND!!! I'm going to include some screenshots. The individual calling us methheads had their @ as SCUBA MAINE before us locals began replying to their hateful comments and they changed it. Couldn't find a website for a business with that name but figured I should mention it so locals can steer clear of that hateful flatlander if they do come across a business with such name. I am absolutely disgusted by the entitlement in the comments sections of these videos and I hope every person who said disgusting things about us locals gets everything they deserve. Dirigo bitch.

Am I overreacting?","description":"Okay so to start off I‚Äôm now in my freshmen yr of highschool..this whole situation happened over summer break Over the summer I was able to go on a school trip to NY. It was really fun don‚Äôt get me wrong! Until it wasn‚Äôt. On this trip it was separated into incoming freshmen (I just finished 8th at the time) and was also a mixture of ppl in 9th. We got there and were first in Washington D.C. before heading over to NYC. I was having a great time with my friends who were also on the trip when we ran into an old friend of theirs. We‚Äôll call him Trevor, I personally didn‚Äôt know him personally. However I would see him around when I was in 7th. Hey later joined us in the many touristy areas of our trip and later started talking to me a lot more often, I didn‚Äôt really think much until we got back into a bus that would have us in there for about 2-3 hrs to drive to NYC. I remember waiting for my friend (we‚Äôll call her Melanie) I waited for a while since I was one of the few people to get on and because of that I put on my headphones and closed my eyes resting my head on the window, Yk just listening to music. After a while I felt someone sit next to me, to my surprise it was Trevor. I immediately got up to go sit next to my friend thinking he probably wanted to sit where I sat. He stopped me and from then I had to sit with him because we were ‚Äúrunning late already‚Äù He tried to make small talk but I felt really uncomfortable, especially since he‚Äôs older and I didn‚Äôt know him that well. He later put on a movie and offered for me to watch, during that time my phone had just died so I thought ‚Äúmight as well‚Äù Near the middle of the movie, which I can‚Äôt remember the name came a funny part. This is kinda where things started to feel really weird. After the funny part had passed he slapped his hand on my thigh and started rubbing it up and down. Immediately I froze and brought my legs closer to myself, which didn‚Äôt do anything because I was sitting in the window spot while he occupied the aisle seat. I didn‚Äôt say anything though because I was scared an altercation would occur and I would end up ruining the trip for everyone. I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs when I messed up, Over the next few days he kept sitting next to me, occasionally rubbing my thigh and knee. It made me really uncomfortable, and I hate how I didn‚Äôt defend myself, I feel as it was my fault because then he started doing something else. He started to push me up against the glass when I would say something to him like, how it made me uncomfortable or when I would tell him to stop. He would force down my hands against my chest so that they were on my chest and then he would push down so I was all up against the glass. While visiting tourist attractions he would follow me around and because of that I would walk very close to my friends. Any time I got. While there we stopped by to watch the Show ‚ÄúHamilton‚Äù it was amazing, and thankfully we had a singed seats. His FARRRR away from mine. One of my teachers who I used to think was really intimidating sat behind me. I zoned out for a bit waiting for the play to start when I felt someone tap my shoulder. I turned my head and my teacher asked me ‚ÄúHey, is Trevor making you uncomfortable?‚Äù She paused glancing over at him ‚ÄúI know you have never been the confrontational type, but if he is bothering you then you can tell me‚Äù I regret not telling her.. I reluctantly smiled at her saying she had nothing to worry about because I was afraid Trevor would hurt me. After I got back to the hotel we were staying at my friends and and I all started our nightly routines, getting ready to go to bed. When one of my friends who ill nickname miffy, asked me ‚Äúare you and Trevor dating?‚Äù I shook my head and asked why ‚ÄúWell I overheard him arguing with ‚ÄòAlex‚Äô for the seat next to you‚Äù I felt my heart drop, I knew it‚Äôs not like he did that much to me but it still felt scary. She later explained that she was standing behind them and that he was willing to pay $100 for the ticket next to me. I never thought I would hear something like that. It made me sick, and that‚Äôs when I later told them everything, how I felt, what he did to me and more. Another one of my friends later spoke up saying ‚ÄúYeah, when we visited Times Square he tried to cover your eyes and say ‚Äòguess who??‚Äô But the teacher (who sat behind me in Hamilton) stopped him saying ‚ÄúNO TREVOR, SHE IS TOO YOUNG FOR YOU!‚Äù It sucked hearing that come out of her mouth, it made me realize so many things could have happened to me and I didn‚Äôt even know. I wonder if I could have even prevented the whole incident. That night all the girls I was staying with in that room vowed to protect me the next day as it was our last before we went home that afternoon. I remember waking up, feeling a sense of dread but relief. We went downstairs for breakfast but saw him going to the elevator so I stayed back with Miffy while Melanie who was close to him told him to stay away from me. Melanie later told me it was safe to come out and for the whole day I felt his eyes on me. I felt his eyes on me the whole day, even occasionally giving me a sad look. One of my guy friends asked what happened between us because we seemed ‚Äúso close throughout the whole trip‚Äù I told him we weren‚Äôt. I later on got these texts: (Check photos in top of post) It was weird because he said what he did was wrong and admitted to it in private how he overstep boundaries. But when it came to my friend groups photos he acted like he didn‚Äôt know. Fast forward to leaving (In the airport) my friend Melanie said that he said, and I quote ‚ÄúI felt safe with (me) and None understands me like her (still talking abt me)‚Äù Although this made me uncomfortable and feel sick to death I was happy I would get rid of him as we boarded on the plane. For the last 3 weeks left of summer he tried to get in contact with me through instagram/Snapchat. It got so bad I asked my sister for help and she texted him to stay away from me. He got mad and defensive and we blocked him. I guess that‚Äôs where it ends. I feel guilty, I feel I could have done more to help myself and I didn‚Äôt. Maybe it was because I was wearing tank tops there, I‚Äôm not sure.. I wish I wasn‚Äôt so unlucky I had past experiences with weird guys but Trevor was different, I‚Äôve been having nightmares constantly I can‚Äôt even sleep anymore. I have these nightmares where Trevor and I are still in the bus and he takes it too far and gR@pes me. But he didn‚Äôt really do anything wrong, so am I in the wrong? I see him everyday at school and he always gets close to me when there is so much space between us. I don‚Äôt know what to do. Am I over exaggerating? I probably am. Let me know what you guys think and if you need more details on what happened, I wasn‚Äôt clear enough I think. -Also if you have advice for how to get at least a full 8 hrs of sleep let me know! I usually get 2-3 hrs now and it‚Äôs really exhausting and hard to not sleep just so I don‚Äôt get those bad dreams of him.-","num_comments":96,"date_posted":"2025-04-06T06:53:20.807Z","community_name":"AmIOverreacting","num_upvotes":2207,"photos":["https://preview.redd.it/what-do-you-call-this-am-i-overreacting-v0-t4zhiajnw5te1.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=0e1aa6c9cad019be8e7864d708320d895fe826fc","https://preview.redd.it/what-do-you-call-this-am-i-overreacting-v0-q531tajnw5te1.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=b5a403dba3f7c6fc1238dc14de3ae4b3626ce26f"],"videos":null,"tag":"üéì

I work in a neuroscience lab and spend most of my day in this office. I share it with 2 other coworkers (we‚Äôre all males) and we are in agreement that it needs some sprucing up. We‚Äôre all open to ideas. I‚Äôve been finding it challenging because the only wall space is in the back, and I‚Äôm worried that hanging some sort of picture/art there would make the room feel shorter and more crammed than it already is (though maybe it wouldn‚Äôt be that bad). My first thought is to bring in some plants, and likely put them on the open desk space in front of that blank wall. That may still have the issue of making the room feel smaller, but it‚Äôs probably worth it. I would get a small plant light for it, which my other coworkers are okay with. One of my coworkers suggested a small fish tank/aquatic terrarium which would be awesome. We all have experience keeping fish and would be able to stay on top of taking care of them. Though the logistics of this would be quite complicated and it‚Äôs unlikely our boss would say yes (given the fire hazard and expensive computers/data nearby). Do you guys have any other suggestions that could spruce this space up?

Later she was inviting me to group activities, but after I declined she mentioned multiple times about meeting for coffee. I agreed but was ready to casually mention that I have a partner, just to avoid any confusion. But she was faster: it turns out she‚Äôs married. In another chat she even revealed she has a kid lol. Point is, all the time her intention was really to make a friend, but I could see for a Scandi man (which I am not) her actions could be perceived as opening the door for something else.

So I have every character at Tekken King or higher including Leo and Leroy at GoD, Law and Asuka at Tekken God, Feng and Clive at Tekken Emperor. I did this in part for coaching purposes as I've been coaching Tekken for about 4 years now and I figured it would be a good idea to be able to know how to play everyone to expand my horizons, knowledge and perspective. It was also a personal project for me to be able to say \"Hey actually I can play everyone to an okay level\" at least. Before I get into my thoughts about characters, fundamentals and the general player base I want to preface by sharing a couple of pieces of context: There are definitely players who have done more than me: I have a friend (Regular-Sized-Majin) who has every character at GoD and I know I'm the first person to be able to play anyone so this is not a boast about how good I am or something. In fact- I believe I am past my prime in Tekken competency and I did this mostly as a learning opportunity and personal project. I think if given all time and no adult responsibilities (I have a wife / kid) then I might be able to do it with most of the characters but it'd take way more time than I have available, and effort to care as well. I am a former Pro Player and have a lot of experience in general: What \"pro\" means in this context is debatable but its the easiest definition for most people. But I have played for Arcade Impact, very briefly for W2W Gaming and XiT Gaming over the years of Tekken 7. I have not been sponsored for Tekken 8 nor am I looking for one. I've won local tournaments and have placed decently high at Combo Breaker and CEO before. I have always considered myself good but never considered myself a top player though I have beaten some. I started with Tekken casually in Tekken 1 and got serious about getting good in Tekken Tag 2 (2012) (best tekken woo). Some don't consider being just sponsored to be enough to be considered pro, some say you need to have a consistent stipend from your sponsor like RedBull or Cloud9 or something and some would say its dependent entirely on skill level. Idk where the real definition is, its just easier to explain my level of experience when I say that. Not that you need to be a pro player to accomplish any of this, I just happened to be one before. I am generally not a \"play everyone\" kind of player : I consider myself more of a character specialist than anything. My real main, Lei Wulong is not in T8 atm and that's who I spent the vast majority of my time on in Tekken in general with additional dabblings in Law, Leo and Leroy. I've had some side characters I've always known how to play but never really tried to learn everyone until now. I don't find everyone fun and interesting nor do I like Tekken enough to be able to enjoy a character for the sake of it being Tekken I did have to force myself through certain characters for the sake of completion. I don't have the best execution : Unless it's for Lei related things or Taunt b+4, execution has always been a bit of a weaker side of me. I don't/can't do Electrics, Wavedashes, Lee b+2 loops, Leo KNK cancel combos and so on. I did use to be able to Korean Backdash decently but ever since my Carpal Tunnel got worse I do drop combos occasionally and backdash cancel poorly Now with that being said, thoughts on this project This took me a bit over half a year to do (been working on this more actively since like early Fall of 2024) but if I was a bit younger and had more free time I think I could've gotten it faster. Characters with previous experience I was able to just jump into. For a characters I had to learn from scratch or nearly from scratch my process was to go through their movelist and pick out a few moves that are generic and strong, stuff like good low pokes, d/f+1/mid poke, approach tools, throws, whiff punisher/block punishers, wall carry options and a \"good enough\" mid screen and wall combo. When I mean \"good enough\" I mean like 60+ dmg at least. Combos in general are not as important as I thought , there were a lot of characters were I didnt launch that often due to muscle memory issues (like WS+2 vs WS+3 for launchers) but I ended up just winning so many interactions in neutral that I really didn't need combos or at least optimal combos that often. Its ironically funny to be outplaying someone hard but then launch them into a very suboptimal combo but then they launch me and do this crazy fancy combo that was 10x better than what I did. For characters' with stances like Hwo, Eddy, Zafina I had to play around with them a bit to get a feel for how their stances are supposed to work. Now I already had an idea mind you but I had to play a decent amount of quick match games to get a real feel for the flow of them. But most stances are based on either pressure or a strong 50/50 game so I mostly had to get used to the idea of: \"What are my transition this stance, what is my 50/50 from this stance\" or alternatively: \"What is my move to keep me in this in stance and the opponent pressured/scared\". Not every stance is like this, like Lee's Hitman, Jun's Miare, Yoshi's Indian/Meditation stance are defensive stances (not without offensive options mind you) ^ To the above point Infinite rematch in quick match is invaluable for learning your character and matchups. It was a great place for me to try new strats and get a feel for the character, knowledge is one thing but constant reps is another. Playstyle wise I am more of a mixup heavy person (my main was Lei after all) but I also really like characters with good pokes, defensive tools and counter hit tools. I'm not much of a spacing player (though Lei was very good at that) and I don't like to play slow. If I can overwhelm the opponent usually I'd rather do that. Despite this Kuma was very fun to play. As for what Blue Ranks in general struggled the most with: I quickly overwhelmed most people through a combination of Poking, Stepping, Punishment, Throws, Balanced Defensive Play and generally good situational awareness Poking: This is something a ton and I really do mean a ton of blue ranks don't utilize well. A lot of people both don't know how to utilize their jab, d/f+1 and equivalent poking strings to create pressure without needing a + frame move nor can they deal with it as well defensively. There are people, Kishin, Bushin rank players even some Tekken King/Emperor players that were overwhelmed simply by Jin 2,1, Devil Jin laser scrapper, Dragunov b+4,2 and mixing up their variations. It's probably not one of the most exciting parts of the game but the \"small Tekken' portion here is really not so small when so much of the playerbase both can't utilize it and get demolished by it. In fact, because I am so bad with EWGF I really chipped people to death with Kazuya's d/b+4, d/f+1,d/f+2, and his d/f+3,2 string. I was somewhat intimidated to learn Zafina because of all the stances but a lot of people just died to d/f+1 vs d/f+1,2 vs d/f+1,2,1 pressure. I didn't need to use much of Raven's somewhat obnoxious defensive tools and high reward 50/50s when 80% of people just died to d/b+2 to BT mixup vs d/b+2,1 vs d/b+2,1,1. Low pokes especially gave a lot of people trouble. People both easily eat lows by the dozen and are easily conditioned by them at the same time. I say this a lot in coaching that a lot of problems would be solved if people did lows more. However I do think most people don't realize how important/strong lows are because everything else too easily. When do you learn to spam Bryan d+4 when his QCB+1 just gives you free turn and counter hits people for a ton of damage? Why learn to spam Stepping: Something that was pretty rare to see was people stepping there were times when I know that my pressure could be stopped a bit if people were to just step at the appropriate times but a lot of people were afraid to, esp to utilize stepping to escape the wall (or throwing to reposition). Conversely I got a lot of people's backsides via stepping at the right junctions. Which also comes from good character knowledge and situational awareness like: Stepping vs a char's weak side when the frame data is light (0 to -4 ish), or stepping a telegraphed WR move, or stepping vs a specific move (SSR duck vs Law DSS, SWL spam vs Kazuya, SWR spam vs Heihachi) Punishment: People just throw out unsafe moves way too much in general. The easier said reward is to create (Law d+2,3, Kazuya CH d/f+2, Lidia f,f+2 oB, Yoshi b+2,2.etc) the more people will spam it. And people are also not used to people taking away their tools from them just based on how often they spam it. So much 1,1,2 while I was DVJ, just so much... The people who esp don't learn to play safer and just keep getting punished to death are often the ones most likely to not complete the FT2 set. Throws: Because of throws having: Mostly homing, anti-power crush and counter hit mechanic I use throws a lot more in T8 than I did in T7 as both an offensive and a defensive tool. Wake up into throw, throw to check a minor frame situation (like after blocking a Heat Burst), command throw to finish off life and then some. Even if the player is halfway decent at throw breaking, I keep trying because persistence >resistance you never know when they're asleep at the wheel. There are also even some fundamentally decent players who have trouble breaking throws which is a major weakness I can exploit from time to time. 1 and 2 Command Throws are especially deadly in this regard. \"Balanced\" defensive play & Situational Awareness: Basically the whole \"Active Defense\" term that's been going around. There are times to mash even when you are minus frames, and there are times to respect frames. I think my experience might be bleeding in here because I confidentally crouch jab or power crush or hopkick a situation given a player's tendencies or confidence in their offense. A lot of people don't know how to get around someone disrespecting their frames usually bc they don't know how to cover evasion/frame trap effectively or take note of when distance/pushback eliminates frame advantage. And there's also a time to be patient like not mashing after a Heat Engager or a Wall Crush or not ducking near the wall/in general, trying to stay close to Bears, stepping/jabbing after a heat burst interaction, stepping after a heat dash, forcing Dragunov to respect you after he uses d+2 (-1 on hit) not facehugging Yoshi after he gets knocked down, not using jabs vs Xiaoyu.etc Character Knowledge: This is probably the #1 thing besides poking that people mega struggled with. Its both a combination of not knowing how to deal with the character that I am playing and not knowing where the gaps in the tools they are using with their own character are. I can recount so many situations of moves gone unpunished, telegraphed WR/mixups, highs not ducked and so on. And on the reverse end, the amount of moves I punished, highs I ducked, low parries on strings like Feng b+2,3,4,2, Law junkyard, Hwoarang 1,1,3,3, Kazuya 1,2,4,3, Jin 1,3,4, Bear 2,1,3.etc a lot of people are just used to these tools being safe and okay to spam. Not to say they aren't ever viable its just that at the rate people use them is a very unsafe way to play. Understandbly that Zafina is a rare character but in 50+ games of Zafina no knew about the Scarecrow 3,3 to Scarecrow 4 Power Crush setup nor did anyone know that SCR 4 is launch punishable. In my previous experience of Tekken, players around the high blues were much harder to cheese with telegraphed strings or spam strings with easily recognizable highs but the player landscape is different. I don't expect everyone to know everyone ofc, I don't even know all the details about every single move but the amount that you can get away with is a little staggering. I do also think the FT2 nature of ranked and how offense oriented this iteration of Tekken is does not help in incentivizing or making it easy to learn matchups. Everyone can be picked up fast enough as long as you have fundamentals: There is an old saying in Tekken that everyone is the same character just bits and pieces of one mythical all encompassing character (Mokujin). If you know how to use Feng d+4 then you know how to use Reina d/b+4, if you know how to whiff punish with Leo df+2 you know how to whiff punish with Claudio hopkick, if you know how to poke with Jin 2,1 / 2,1,4 you know how to poke with King d/f+1 / d/f+1,2, if you know how to approach with Dragunov WR+2 you know how to approach with Zafina WR+1+2, if you know how to hit grounded with Lars DEN 2 you know how to hit grounded with Kazuya f,f+4. When you grasp an understanding of each of the common situations and how to tie your character's move to them you can really learn anyone with the exception of some executionally hard stuff like EWGF or Lee just frames that take a bit more time. Or chars with just a ton of moves like Hwo or Xiaoyu, even those chars who are more unorthodox still do \"orthodox\" things just through different ways. Hwo pressures with RFF and Flamingo is not different from Law just spamming f+1+2 into WS+4 DSS into either mixups or more pressure options. Xiaoyu giving a safe move on block as a bait to go into BT or AOP and evade is not different from Yoshi flashing in response to him being - or Feng using u/f +2 after his 1,3 is blocked. I am not trying to say this is easy in general, since fundamentals even getting good at them is a journey and process in itself. But once the foundations are solid then yes this does become easier. Stats most of them I don't really care about the only one I do care about is defense. Most players I fight in blues are 60 or below. The *really* mashy people are around 40-50 defense. And a lot of them tend to be characters with extra defensive tools and or very good power crushes. Mine changes a lot based on who I'm playing but usually around 80-95 defense. Who was the easiest to blow people up vs hardest: Easiest: Characters with strong and easily accessed pressure and pokes Easiest: Characters with high reward combos/punishment Easiest: Rare characters where most people don't know anything about the matchup Hardest: Characters requiring execution (personal thing for me) Hardest: Characters who rely on special conditions too much (Lidia's reliance on f,f+2 CH, Steve requiring CH or spamming Lionheart's meh mixup) I found Reina to be the hardest bc of the execution and how unsafe/lower reward her mixups are. Her pokes are great but I am generally a low spammy kind of player. I also really cannot electric so playing Mishimas without electrics was... interesting, DVJ and Kazuya at least have way better mixups than Reina so I found them easier. I also found Hwo to be hard because of just all the memorization (ironic for a Lei player) but eventually you do find your flow with him. I found Panda to be the easiest by the fact that I had just learned Kuma before Panda. So I went into Panda with a lot of experience from Kuma. But it's that and: Bear keepout and space control is so strong most people have a Blue Screen in terms of trying to counter it, its extremely toxic to play against in general and double so for the average blue rank. + Bear combo damage is so insanely high with their general combo damage into that absurd wall combo that's probably getting nerfed that you really don't need to win a lot of interactions as Bear. Ironic since Bears are so defensive coded but that reward and spacing goes a long way. Tl;DR The average playerbase generally suck using and against Poking Character Knowledge Stepping Lows Throws Active Defense Playing a lot of other characters its easier when you have fundamentals and experience Obtaining solid fundamentals is not obvious nor is it necessarily easy but once they have been established, the floodgates open to any character. If anyone is curious about how to improve generally or what most players X problem happy to discuss it here.

Its a really good idea to learn how to mix up poking strings with Jack, esp centering around stuff like: 2 / 2,1 f+1 / f+1,1 d/b+1 FC d/b+1 / FC d/b+1,1 / FC d/b+1,1,1 WS+2 / WS+2,1 / WS+2,4 f+3 / f+3, d to Gamma Howl / f+3,1+2 If there's a character that not only extremely benefits from but also depends heavily on poking, it's Jack. Need to know how to chip people to death and then read when they will break and otherwise get some good timed d/f+2, f+2, and f,f+1. And a gameplan for the character I'm playing or the character i'm playing against? Because mostly I have a default gameplan for my character, moves I try to abuse more, center a gameplan around and I adjust that based on the playstyle of the opponent's character- modified by opponent player-playstyle/skill level. Like I can just play extremely unsafe all day if I can gauge if an opponent will just get easily overwhelmed by what I do or doesn't know how to punish.

The other kind of Yoshi is this more streamlined defensive, keepout and poking character that still ultimately baits into defensive situations. So at heart, Yoshi is a defensive character because his two most stand out tools, Flash and Manji Super Spin are incredibly strong, the two best defensive moves in the game. Yoshi however conversely is not super amazing offense wise because he doesn't have many moves that force + on block, a so-so d/f+1 and kind of awkward set of low pokes. So he's not really a mixup character but what he does excel in is controlling space and fishing for counter hits (SS+1, FC d/f+4, CD+2, in heat: f+1+2) as well as some mid ranged pokes that have good range and have good risk/reward mixups out of them such as d/f+3,1 vs d/f+3 to crouch, b+2 vs b+2 to KIN. And some good approach tools with 3~4, WR+3,u to Dragonfly, f,f+4, f,f+3. He's not so much a sustained offense kind of character as he is a \"Hopefully I catch you with this random move, hopefully on Counter Hit in open space\" kind of character. While occasionally low poking with d/b+3,3... vs d/b+3,3,4, FC d/f+4 or d/b+4. Barring that, he thrives greatly when the opponent is trying to take their turn recklessly vs him. Because Flash is the fastest move in the game (i6) and has pretty big reward, its ideal to look for situations where the opponent is likely to take their turn and attack so that Yoshi can bait them into Flash or evade with Super Spin into launching whiff punish (Usually with CD+1). That means Yoshi can uniquely stop pressure moves that normally would force the opponent to be more respectful defense wise. For example after Leo d/f+2+3, and Law SS+3, Yoshi flash will interrupt almost every option possible from both Leo and Law, something pretty much no one else can do. Super Spin does the same thing so long as the incoming move from the opponent is not a homing move. Once Yoshi has his launcher and or counter hit, its his job to take the opponent to the wall where not only is his wall combo (NSS/Heat 3,2, delayed 1+2) strong but his wall okizeme is incredibly powerful. If you do the short wall combo, 2 Jab -> f+1+2 and cause flipover Oki you create this very cheap situation where if the opponent does not tech roll here, they can eat basically infinite f+1+2's from Yoshi, if they do tech roll Yoshi can prep FC d/f+1 Samurai Cutter low unblockable to be more or less guaranteed on wakeup as long as he times it right. This creates a verrrrrrrrrry hard to outplay situation where the opponent is damned if they stay down, and damned if they get up. So in essence it's: Occasionally Poke/Fish for Counter Hits Mid Screen -> Launcher -> wall -> stupid wall oki or high dmg wall combo -> Poke till dead Let opponents pressure you -> Flash or Spin -> Heat/Launcher -> Wall -> Stupid Wall or high dmg wall combo -> Poke till dead The stance stuff is good too, but we could be here all talking about the uses of moves in the stances. I'll just say that Dragonfly has the most straight forward mixup (FLY 3+4 vs FLY 4) and NSS has very powerful counter hit moves (1,1, d/f+3,1), a very strong FC low launcher (FC d/f+3) and a bigger Flash hitbox (but slower). Indian, meditation and Flea are good too but niche you don't need to use them per se.","date_of_reply":null,"num_replies":0,"num_upvotes":1}]},{"comment":"I'm shocked Reina is rated low on the fun","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Tekken/comments/1jgkwhi/comment/mjahkbe/","user_commenting":"GeForce","user_url":"https://www.reddit.com/user/GeForce/","date_of_comment":null,"num_upvotes":1,"num_replies":1,"replies":[{"user_replying":"PepperBeef2Spicy","user_url":"https://www.reddit.com/user/PepperBeef2Spicy/","reply":"Why I'm not crazy about Reina is mostly bc of playstyle and execution.

Most are REALLY good, i have only given four stars to one regular seller because she does regularly downplay minor issues with her items and if something is missing from a set, she will only mention it buried in a long description and won't ever tell you, so you hopefully don't notice ...

After all of the advice, recommendations, and market research, I somewhat controversially went with the Coachmen Catalina 18RDL. I had taken a job that required my physical presence Monday-Friday in a location about 550 miles away from my home, and I wanted to be home most weekends whenever feasible. I did this from October thru late April, fortunately I'm now able to work remotely and no longer have to do this silliness. Now, for context, before attending law school, I drove tractor trailer over-the-road throughout all 48 lower states, Mexico, and Canada; specifically, I pulled doubles/triples, flatbed, and oversize/over-dimension. Feel free to AMA... so, without further ado, here we go! Equipment : -2022 F-250 Lariat SB Tremor --Engine: 7.3L 2V DEVCT NA PFI V8 \"Godzilla\" --Rear Axle: Dana M275 --Rear Differential: 4.30:1 gearing with electronic locking differential --1200-lb WD hitch Combination Dimensions : -Length: ~62' -Width: 8'6\" -Height: 13'6\" -Weight: ~18,500-lbs Transport Experience : While its tires are rated for 75mph, I could not possibly imagine dragging it that fast down the interstate. I keep it between 55-62mph and it handles like a dream. My truck averaged ~6.8-mpg, which is actually slightly better than I expected. The only downside is that because the axles are so centrally located, it is VERY sensitive to weight distribution. I experimented a little bit with my two 50-gal Stanley tough-boxes I had from the Army, each weighing about 150-lbs. ‚Äî I strapped both boxes side-by-side on the porch and filled the fresh water tank completely. The trailer was so squirrelly it was comically terrifying, and could not be driven safely over 40-mph. But this would be fine if you were just moving sites within a park or taking it to a dump site and back. ‚Äî Both boxes arranged linearly inside the trailer, in front of the furniture; i.e., not down the stepdown into the kitchen/bathroom. Full fresh tank. Definitely uncomfortably squirrelly on the interstate, but it handled perfectly fine if you kept it to 45-mph or less. So this would be fine if you were only going a few miles over local/back roads. ‚Äî Same as above, fresh water dumped completely. A slight difference, but still squirrelly at highway speeds. ‚Äî Both boxes down the stepdown so that one box is in the bathroom and the other is in the kitchen. Perfect. No issues, very stable at highway speeds. The fresh tank could have been filled and I don‚Äôt think it would have made any appreciable difference, good or bad. Winter use : Honestly, it handled remarkably well in cold weather. I used a heated water hose, and I had pipe heaters and some fiberglass insulation wrapped around my tank valves and sewer hose water trap, plus a tarp draped over everything to keep the snow off. I would burn through about 10-lbs of propane per day during the coldest months, but it was too easy. Occasionally a propane tank would freeze solid if it was low on propane and it was especially cold outside. I plan to upgrade from two 20-lb tanks to two 30-lb tanks, and next winter, I'll get a heated blanket to wrap around the tanks. A skirt of some kind for the whole trailer would have helped with insulation, but I don't know if it's worth the extra setup time. Surprisingly, the curtains along the glass walls do an excellent job of keeping both the heat and the A/C insulated. When it's above freezing out, the heat pump works supremely well at keeping a stable temperature inside the trailer. And the massive electric furnace in the master loft is an absolute game changer, I kept it set to 74 the whole winter and it was perfection. Build Quality & Durability : Alright, so, I've put down close to 20k miles and it has been phenomenal. Truly. There has been zero damage or visible wear from transportation, hooking, dropping. In fact, I stopped stowing most countertop items for transport and I've never so much as tipped over a flower pot. In fact, on one trip, I placed full cups of water in the shower and kitchen sink, and neither spilled a drop over the trip. I will say that despite its size and shape, it is absolutely engineered to be dragged to hell and back‚Äîit is truly more travel trailer than destination trailer. Okay, now, the part I'm sure most people were waiting for, the quality defects. (1) One particularly miserable wet/cold night dropping the trailer on a fairly uneven spot, I was tired and made an error that caused both front scissor jacks to collapse and taco themselves. Turns out that the stabilizing jacks rated for 10,000-lbs referred to all four together , which meant that they were only rated for 2,500-lbs individually. I removed those and used a set of 20-ton bottle jacks for a few weeks, until I had the chance to replace them with a much beefier set of scissor jacks rated for 9,000-lbs each. Mounting the new jacks did require enlarging the existing bolt holes in the frame, but otherwise it was an easy job. (2) The first shower I took revealed that in the sliding door track, the corner was never caulked, which caused water to spill out onto the floor. Easy fix, I caulked with clear silicone. (3) In the kitchen sink, where the drain is mated to the sink inside the sink basin, I don't know what type of caulking/grouting they used, but it was absolutely NOT heat resistant. One day while scrubbing the sink with hot water and a brush, I managed to spread sticky grey caulking all over the sink. A half-hour of Goo-Gone & shop rags got it all cleaned up. I re-caulked with clear silicone. (4) The little plastic bit meant to keep the bathroom hanging/sliding door hugging the wall pulled out of the wall on like, day 1; I never repaired it because it wasn't that big of a deal. I'll get to it this summer when I do the rest of my internal maintenance. (5) One of my kids accidentally pulled a kitchen pantry cabinet door off by hanging on while opening it (not playing on it, but like, not just opening it straight, but opening it with a lot of downward force, because kids are short lol). I almost like it better without the door, I'll rehang it this summer. (6) The city water port sucks absolute buttholes. It is just the worst kind of soft plastic and hard rubber that it is chewed up to hell now, and I'll need to replace the whole port this summer. (7) During transport, the sliding glass back door manages to unlock itself and slide open. This isn't a *problem* per se, but it does lead to every three drivers honking at you to tell you the back door is open. I secure it shut with a bungee cord hooked to the loft-ladder-- I need to invent a more permanent solution this summer. (8) Okay, now, this was the biggest issue only because it was such a fucking goose chase trying to diagnose and fix. So, annoyingly, the bathroom GFI initiates the whole receptacle line downstairs (the other two being above the kitchen counter, and on the wall behind the recliner chair. Well, mid-winter, a breaker blew and I could absolutely not figure out why. A lot of swearing and re-wiring later, it turns out the bathroom GFI had been wired backwards. I replaced that GFI receptacle and also the fuse in the breaker panel. While I was in the breaker panel, a full 85% of the set-screws holding the ground wires were super loose or had fallen out entirely. An eye roll and a few minutes later, everything was good as new... or better than new, rather. (9) On the passenger side, there's a water port for the internal black tank flush sprayer. That water pipe is under the kitchen sink where it meets a tree and goes down into the black tank. One of the joints where it lies under the kitchen sink is not doped at all, which means that every time I used the flush, I also managed to piss several gallons of water into the cabinet below the sink and onto the kitchen floor. Once I figured out what the issue was, I stopped using the black tank flush and would just dump a few 5-gal buckets of hot water down the toilet when I flushed the black tank. I'll fix that this summer.

I had 5 straight winning days where I managed to secure a $25K payout, building a $10K buffer on each account through scalping and catching momentum trades. I caught trades during the London session on Monday, fueled by the Trump-China deal news, and on Tuesday during CPI(note I did not trade during CPI, I traded after NY open where I caught the longs) where I rode the strong bullish momentum to the upside. These were directional moves, and I traded them close to perfection. After securing the payout, Topstep compliance team requested additional verification, such as a government-issued ID and facial recognition scan, which I provided. However, today I received an update from TopstepX‚Äôs compliance team stating: We regret to inform you that you can no longer trade with Topstep in a Trading Combine¬Æ or at the Funded Level. Violation of our Terms of Use Policy, sections 3/8/16. It is effective immediately and indefinitely.\" I know I‚Äôve done nothing wrong. According to them, I violated their Terms and Conditions under vague and loosely interpreted circumstances‚Äîsupposed ‚Äúloopholes.‚Äù For example, Section 3 of their policy states: \"If you lodge an unjustifiable complaint regarding the paid fee or dispute the paid fee with your bank or payment service (e.g., through chargeback services), Topstep is entitled, at its sole discretion, to stop providing services and refuse future services.\" I have never filed a chargeback or disputed any payment ever nor has any one in the family did. Another part of Section 3 states: \"If you place an unusually large number of orders for Services in an unreasonably short period of time (e.g., in excess of 3 resets in a 24-hour period or multiple Trading Combines¬Æ), as determined by Topstep‚Äôs sole discretion, they reserve the right to suspend services.\" I understand they may be referring to resets and combine purchases. However, I‚Äôve seen plenty of traders copy-trade five eval accounts, blow them, and reset them. Apparently, that can count as five resets in 24 hours, even if you reset all five at once. For reference, on the highest orders day which was Monday, I had about 300‚Äì400 trades. These were micros , scaled in and out manually. I didn‚Äôt use limit sell with right-click (which would count as a single order for 10‚Äì15 micro contracts). Instead, I would manually click the sell button for partial exits‚Äîeach one counted as an individual trade. I was also trading/ scalping during the Asian, London, and early New York sessions‚Äîbasically from 6:00 PM to 12:00 PM the next day thus the amount of trades, Monday and Tuesday were where I caught the big moves with Trump China Deal and CPI and ofc with clear setups for bullish upside. I was scalping and in and out of micros. Of-course, I also cut losses by scaling out micros manually through the buy or sell 1 by 1 and when I saw re-tracement on bad trades, I would scale out manually too, unless it was above 50 micros then the limit sell/buy option of 10-15 would make sense. I wasn't even sizing that big, it was like 10-30 micros, on average it's always 10-15. On Wednesday, I did blow some of the XFAs because of market chop. Today, I started a fresh 150K account and hit $10K again within two days. I caught a clean move during London session, recognized the same low setup from the previous day, and when I saw confirmation of bullish reversal, I entered with max 3 minis and 30 micros. I scaled all the way up from the bottom and caught the day‚Äôs low. Section 8 states: \"These standards are not met where you open substantially larger or smaller position sizes compared to your other trades. Topstepx reserves the right to determine, at its sole discretion, what qualifies as Prohibited Conduct.\" I don‚Äôt believe I violated this. During my five winning days, I didn‚Äôt take oversized trades. On Wednesday, after the payout was already requested and deducted, I admit I became more aggressive, scaling up to 15 minis/150 micros after taking losses in the chop chop, this was the only time I scaled this much, before that I never scaled this big or after I lost my funded accounts this very same day. Somehow, I lost control of my emotion and started revenge trading. I tried to scalp my way back, which ultimately caused me to blow a lot of the buffer‚Äîbut this was after the payout request. Section 16 states: \"Your account is personal to you and cannot be shared, sold, or assigned. You are only allowed one account. Any activity involving shared accounts or multiple accounts may result in termination.\" I only have one account. One other family member in my household also has an account. Maybe they flagged the shared IP or same device usage via Wi-Fi, but we‚Äôve never taken opposite trades or coordinated anything that would violate Section 27 (collusion). If anything, it seems I got flagged because I had a high number of resets and maybe they saw my payout as a red flag. To clarify, I‚Äôve had about 125 combine resets over, including new account creations. I‚Äôve also blown 13 funded accounts‚Äîall 50Ks. Five were copy-traded and blown twice. That‚Äôs why I eventually moved to 150Ks because of the bigger MLL buffer and trade with more flexibility where I can size up my micros then what's the point of the scaling plans if accordingly to Topstepx is used to liquidate you so they can make more money from evals and blown funded, but use it against you to deny you a payout if you are a risk which I believe they have identified me to be, but it doesn't make any sense. I wish they had given me a warning, at least maybe flagged my activity as excessive and given me a chance to adjust before my payout period. Instead, they seem to have marked me as high risk, especially because I secured a large payout in such a short time. ( I have years of experience trading options specifically QQQ, I recently switched to future to trade NQ and was recommended Topstepx and all fell off the cliff within a month) Sometimes I scalp small buffers on evals and, when I get a solid A or B+ setup, I go in full in with minis. If it works, great‚Äîif it blows, so be it. I am sure many other people have done this too, some people even full send it during news, and I checked around and made sure it was okay, etc, but I never did anything with malicious intent. I genuinely think Topstepx just didn‚Äôt want to pay me out. I reached out to appeal, offering like all kind of evidences and verification to justify the unfair violation/ban but the response was simply along the line of: \"All traders agree to our Terms of Service upon signup. After review, your account was deemed in violation, and is now permanently closed.\" I hope my denied payout/banned account for violation at topstep will help out the traders in here to not make the same mistakes I did, through micros scaling, taking too many trades a day, well specific to micro scaling in, to never use that buy and sell button if you micro scale, but to do a limit sell through right click for 10-15 micros. Also to be wary of the compliance team because they might just at their own discretion prevent you from getting a payout because I am sure all of us have violated TOS in a small way or another and that fact they can vaguely make these statements as through loopholes through their own laws basically as TOS to prevent you from getting a payout sucks, I know it won't happen to probably like 95% of the other traders who are profitable or get a payout, but yeah I guess topstepx is slowly and increasingly denying people their payout unless I have done something wrong with my style of trading then please tell me. Anyways, If you have read all this, thank you, and best of luck.","num_comments":195,"date_posted":"2025-05-16T21:54:16.629Z","community_name":"TopStepX","num_upvotes":118,"photos":["https://preview.redd.it/topstepx-almost-25k-in-payout-denied-15k-pending-discretion-v0-tz5yxm1er71f1.png?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=9c757bcfa4122083c561d3b55e556e1a240a7b95","https://preview.redd.it/topstepx-almost-25k-in-payout-denied-15k-pending-discretion-v0-zrzlapber71f1.png?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=ee599bdbf47165d49e16c16367dbd7079e170854","https://preview.redd.it/topstepx-almost-25k-in-payout-denied-15k-pending-discretion-v0-j9176iger71f1.png?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=e2ef14176c3872650ed80f6245fc8d7b49fd2043","https://preview.redd.it/topstepx-almost-25k-in-payout-denied-15k-pending-discretion-v0-oo47eiler71f1.png?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=6713ed0a68cc21ad8c6d44a39dddb9253c2c79bd","https://preview.redd.it/topstepx-almost-25k-in-payout-denied-15k-pending-discretion-v0-ju29xpqer71f1.png?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=216892fb74656e09a7c246d8a1ae77361d8dd05d","https://preview.redd.it/topstepx-almost-25k-in-payout-denied-15k-pending-discretion-v0-am5xafver71f1.png?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=ed398f249cb82411b8b8f816bffd07e485e3c706"],"videos":null,"tag":"Express Funded (XFA)","related_posts":[{"community":"topstepx","community_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/TopStepX/comments/1lfsb89/after_88500_of_payouts_topstep_has_handicapped_me/","title":"After $88,500 of payouts topstep has handicapped me","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/TopStepX/comments/1lfsb89/after_88500_of_payouts_topstep_has_handicapped_me/","thumbnail":null,"num_upvotes":"262","num_comments":148},{"community":"topstepx","community_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/TopStepX/comments/1lwrvhw/first_time_doing_topstep_150k_account_first_payout/","title":"First time doing Topstep, 150K account first payout","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/TopStepX/comments/1lwrvhw/first_time_doing_topstep_150k_account_first_payout/","thumbnail":null,"num_upvotes":"155","num_comments":37},{"community":"topstepx","community_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/TopStepX/comments/1lzyxji/consistent_topstep_payouts_1k5kweek_but_lowkey_no/","title":"Consistent Topstep Payouts ($1K‚Äì$5K/Week) but low-Key no Hype.

MK World: A good upgrade that (gladly) feels distinct enough from past entries. The KO Mode is the best thing that could have happened to the franchise, although i must say that the Grand Prix is worse than before imo. Still a good game and i'm hyped for launch day. Hades II: Idk it was not overwhelming, it's still good and it's Hades but the Demo was not mindblowing. Metroid Prime 4: My favourite game from the Event. The visuals are gorgeous, mouse mode works perfect in this game and the Demo was a lot of fun. It in fact was so good i went to a store afterwards and grabbed MP1 Remastered cause i never played MP before lol Cyberpunk: Very good port, graphically it Obviously stinks compared to other consoles but it is nowhere near as bad as Witcher 3 on Switch 1, it runs well and looks good enough docked and very good in Handheld mode. Imo a perfect Day 1 Singleplayer game. Zelda Botw/Totk Switch 2 Edition: Better than expected, the videos on youtube did these upgrades dirty, the games look fabulous and the graphical improvements alone are good enough to revisit these games on Switch 2. As i am a member of NSO EP i will definitely out some time into these games again. DK Bananza: A fun 3D platformer that will be a blessing for completionists, anywhere you want to go you will find something. Many elements are recycled or remade from Odyssey or past 3D Marios but in a good way, it will definitely be the best 3D Mario Substitute someone can get. Drag x Drive: Yeah no lies here this game sucks, the mouse mode works good here and honestly the HD Rumble was cool but other than that the controls are horrible and this game will have a worse fate than Arms had. Would rather pick up the Welcome Tour for 10 bucks. This was every game i tried, other than that i can say that the console in handheld mode feels way better tham before, the Joy Cons are finally usable and although they lack Hall Effect the sticks definitely are improved, hopefully they will not drift. And the Pro Controller also got some smaller QoL Updates which make it way more comfortable to use, for people who play much this will be an investment worth the money. This is everything i have to say, i had lots of fun at the event!","num_comments":363,"date_posted":"2025-04-27T12:56:17.043Z","community_name":"NintendoSwitch2","num_upvotes":1976,"photos":["https://preview.redd.it/went-to-the-switch-2-experience-in-berlin-heres-my-thoughts-v0-qxe16pzikdxe1.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=b73b343eedec70ccb6fbc960357548407ee0d4a9","https://preview.redd.it/went-to-the-switch-2-experience-in-berlin-heres-my-thoughts-v0-a0pv3e5jkdxe1.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=ee591ce60944600ba78d29386967e15b4d7e620d","https://preview.redd.it/went-to-the-switch-2-experience-in-berlin-heres-my-thoughts-v0-ojycmiajkdxe1.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=bce08cc9517aa947c93cd733b6564b18e7ed817b","https://preview.redd.it/went-to-the-switch-2-experience-in-berlin-heres-my-thoughts-v0-jkynrafjkdxe1.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=2346527a762f0a521def3e24f76da5cf3f1d9e2d","https://preview.redd.it/went-to-the-switch-2-experience-in-berlin-heres-my-thoughts-v0-n3ynxtjjkdxe1.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=0fc496d6f3e0c33c4e054622f3bd0158294b1a34","https://preview.redd.it/went-to-the-switch-2-experience-in-berlin-heres-my-thoughts-v0-gzcebwojkdxe1.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=72d1fac3f65b03ad455e9ff9d106be482a85959c"],"videos":null,"tag":"Media (Image, Video, etc.)","related_posts":[{"community":"nintendoswitch2","community_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1k7ni8b/at_the_switch_2_experience_but_didnt_get_in_ama/","title":"At the Switch 2 Experience but didn't get in, AMA","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1k7ni8b/at_the_switch_2_experience_but_didnt_get_in_ama/","thumbnail":null,"num_upvotes":"548","num_comments":149},{"community":"nintendoswitch2","community_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1kqid7y/why_are_you_so_excited_about_the_switch_2/","title":"Why are you so excited about the Switch 2?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1kqid7y/why_are_you_so_excited_about_the_switch_2/","thumbnail":null,"num_upvotes":"235","num_comments":292},{"community":"nintendoswitch2","community_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1m6xpxg/is_anyone_still_struggling_to_get_a_switch_2/","title":"Is anyone still struggling to get a Switch 2?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1m6xpxg/is_anyone_still_struggling_to_get_a_switch_2/","thumbnail":null,"num_upvotes":"101","num_comments":296},{"community":"nintendoswitch2","community_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1jrtuus/wanted_to_share_some_photos_from_the_switch_2/","title":"Wanted to share some photos from the Switch 2 Experience in NYC earlier today!","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1jrtuus/wanted_to_share_some_photos_from_the_switch_2/","thumbnail":null,"num_upvotes":"583","num_comments":133},{"community":"nintendoswitch2","community_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1lzoqkn/love_my_switch_2/","title":"Love my switch 2","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1lzoqkn/love_my_switch_2/","thumbnail":null,"num_upvotes":"459","num_comments":78},{"community":"nintendoswitch2","community_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1ly7k32/switch_2_might_just_be_my_favorite_console_of_all/","title":"Switch 2 might just be my favorite console of all time","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1ly7k32/switch_2_might_just_be_my_favorite_console_of_all/","thumbnail":null,"num_upvotes":"409","num_comments":373},{"community":"switch2","community_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/switch2/comments/1li3q86/i_love_the_switch_2_thats_pretty_much_it/","title":"I love the Switch 2.

I grew up on the poor side my family is pretty bogan ( for Americans just search it up) I grew up around drugs, alcohol, sex, fighting and a lot of racism which I also took part of.even though I never did drugs I drank from like 13 and my parents didn‚Äôt care and others in my neighbourhood were similar. and I seen a bunch of worse shit that I‚Äôve seen (sex parties, weird, illegal shit) for a long time I was racist not outwardly like my parents but said racist shit for their validation because it was normalise in my family always talking down on anyone who wasn‚Äôt fully white, example my parents would talk about how Africans come here and get free money (‚ÄúCentrelink‚Äù, Americans think of government money assistance idk) etc meanwhile we also did too. My parents refused to work and just didn‚Äôt give two shits. They keep having more kids so the government gives them more money I have 7 siblings. As I grew up I become worse more drinking etc etc. I went to public school where one of the girls who was popular or well known was African. She came to Australia and they moved into our town when she was three. Anyone who was apart of my friend group mostly the girls would talk shit say she acts up her self etc and spew racist stuff, so I was around racism all the time. She never associated really or took notice of us besides maybe academic interactions if we were forced into group projects but she seemed nice enough. Her family lived in middle class and were one of the few African who had been in town for decades ( not sure how many black families we have in my town etc but a few about 25 families not included the individuals/kids ) anyways fast forward I dropped out of high school which wasn‚Äôt odd for my parents they wanted me to get a job and sucked me dry for drugs, and I ended up getting fired because they would constantly steal from my job. Was hanging out with my friends one time and that specific African girls name came up as our we were talking about our graduating class and those who moved away and we were talking about and wondering where most of the people we were up to. One of the guys said shit about how she thought she was all that as she had worked with a well known American celebrity. We searched her and she was at one of Australia‚Äôs top universities and living in the big city about two hours away. That night I went down a rabbit hole and kinda looked at her social media and honestly felt jealous. She had pictures with her parents and siblings that were all doing pretty good. ( and she was prettier than ever, she is 5‚Äô2 fit as fuck, but with these amazing curves at the same time, has long braids and looks like mix of Rihanna and Zoe Salda√±a but dark skin tone. And no I‚Äôm not kidding wish I could post her instagram!) I ended up following her on ig and she followed me back . Months go by and I dm her and she replies surprisingly. We start chatting and she said she remembers me from a few classes we had together. I was fully surprised as I wasn‚Äôt expecting her to. I ended up going to the city asking if we could hang out she couldn‚Äôt but then a few weeks later we did. When we met up she was super nice I asked her what she was up to she was humble to say the least and obviously felt a little awkward about sharing. She asked me the same and I for once felt super embarrassed I didn‚Äôt have a job was living with my parents house. that was 2021, again fastfward I ended up really falling for her but she didn‚Äôt feel the same and wouldn‚Äôt tell me why. We distant bit and I again a year later hit her up, she stated she missed being friends and wanted to respect my space. We met up and I asked her to tell me why she didn‚Äôt want to date back then and that I wasn‚Äôt into her so she could be honest with me she said she really didn‚Äôt want too. I had to tease her and asked her if it was because of **** and because I wasn‚Äôt a famous athlete jokingly( she briefly dated an AFL player big deal in Australia, for my Americans that‚Äôs like nfl famous) and she told me she didn‚Äôt feel the same because we were to different I got mad assuming she ment money but she said no and referenced my drinking ( said her family is pretty conservative as it‚Äôs their culture, shes never drunk before or anything else that was normal in my life) and the people I associated with and their known racist antics around town. We talked more and she had revealed a lot to me about high school and how some of the guys had bullied her and would message her their dicks, asking her for nudes and saying weird shit ( really caught of guard) she showed evidence and I was disgusted. I apologise as those guys were my friends some still were and she convinced me that it wasn‚Äôt exclusive to just my friends even the specialist kids (jocks for my Americans) she was friends with would do the same, but she only pointed it out as they were intentionally racist while secretly harassing her for nudes . After the conversation I realised I also contribute to some racist shit me and my friends would say and thought it was harmless and I was bought up with my parents saying stuff all the time. We had a three hour conversation and I left feeling defeated, embarrassed and just mentally fucked. I spoke to her here and there but I decided I was tired of feeling shitty about my life and quit drinking. And started working out, staying at a friends house instead of my parents, I also got a job at woolies (grocery store) I didn‚Äôt tell her I got a job because it felt a little embarrassing and I didn‚Äôt finish high school so there‚Äôs only so much I can do ( I am thinking of going to tafe) she ended up graduating got a job and is working and doing her second degree a masters degree almost done now (2025) we hung out in early 2024 and I told her I had feelings again she asked if I wanted space and I said nah I would just work through it regardless she distant her self, after a while we were cool again and she found out a had a job and congratulated me and didn‚Äôt judge. I felt shitty still cause I saw her as having this big job and I was working at a grocery store as a 24 year old. She told me she wanted to hang out and when we did she got me a card basically writing nice things and saying she was proud of my success and whatever is to come, this was the first time I didn‚Äôt feel shit about where I was at. That same night we kissed and just stayed at her place until it was late and I left as I didn‚Äôt want to take any chances and ask to stay the night or whatever. I texted her the next day to see if she regretted she said no, and I asked her what changed and she said it was good to see me wanting something for myself and she didn‚Äôt care what it was as long as I was doing stuff for myself and that it was attractive, this made me want to grind harder. I honestly don‚Äôt know how or why but she liked me. She wanted to take it slow. It‚Äôs about November 2024 and we are dating exclusively still going out on dates and taking turns paying, planning and all that stuff. Hadn‚Äôt slept together either but everything was great. She ended asking to meet my friends and everything she told me from a few years back flushed into my head, I hadn‚Äôt told her I was still friends with some of them, she never asked for me to stop or anything but that would be the expectation for anyone idk. But at the same time they‚Äôve helped me when my parents were feral so I felt a sense of obligation to keep a form of the friendship. I would say we weren‚Äôt close either now but still associated. They gave me shit when I stopped my drinking and our priories changed. And they didn‚Äôt know I was dating her. I told her about friends I had made through work i would bring to a little gathering, she said cool and said I just want to meet all friends and people you hang out with and I didn‚Äôt want to hide anything from her, New Year‚Äôs Eve December she meets my friends, and they were pretty shit face but she had a good poker face and didn‚Äôt judge, (though i know this isn‚Äôt her scene) she laughed with my friends and we did have fun that night, until one of the other guys was left alone with her and said some racist shit to her thinking it was funny, and supposedly a compliment about her body, she told him sarcastically funny, and that flipped my friend off (not friends anymore) and he said out loud that was a joke, if you want real racist shit wait till you hear what **** (me and my family) say about black people. I was red faced and embarrassed. my work friends looked at me weirdly as they hadn‚Äôt known me that long to know I was shitty and I have truly been working at changing. Anyways she looks at me and smiles and just walks to talk to my work friends. That car ride was awkward and she didn‚Äôt say a thing, I finally spoke up and said sorry, and she said for what. I felt shit as this was the first time we‚Äôve had any conflict or I had seen her look so sad, she ended saying she doesn‚Äôt know how to handle this and why I want to date her if she‚Äôs not my type and I could‚Äôve left her alone. I tried to explain my life and what I had grown up around and tried to tell her I change and she said she gave me the benefit of doubt by dating me even though she knew who I had associated with. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm being selfish by saying I think we should keep dating, I really like her way more than she knows, she‚Äôs is my type I wasn‚Äôt racist because I hated black/African people it was literally what I was taught my whole life. She makes me feel good, makes my life feel less shit and I know that‚Äôs not her responsibility but she is a good person genuinely a beautiful girl inside and out. But idk how to go about this she mentioned feeling uncomfortable with dating me, idk what to do. We haven‚Äôt spoken in three weeks but she also hasn‚Äôt blocked me. When I call her she doesn‚Äôt pick up and says she‚Äôs busy and just needed time. And I do get her side. But also I‚Äôm not that person anymore, and I message my friend and in this text he double down feeling nothing for his actions and what they have done to the girl I thought I could see myself being with forever. My work friends are quiet and awkward around me and I know they‚Äôve told others. I know I should give her space I know but I don‚Äôt want to let her go. Please‚Ä¶ I feel so stupid, I have completely stopped seeing my parents who are still the same, and stopped any lingering association with my so called friend. What do I do next please. AITAH if I ask her to just give me one chance and hear me out?? I want to write a similar message like this and send to her with my life experience. I‚Äôve never written this much over anybody let alone a girl‚Ä¶ I just want her to know that‚Äôs not me.","num_comments":297,"date_posted":"2025-01-21T12:11:18.941Z","community_name":"AmIOverreacting","num_upvotes":209,"photos":["https://preview.redd.it/aio-my-past-and-racist-friends-has-ruined-my-relationship-v0-men72c309cee1.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=cfac3911e991091e665b46404137ee193c68d4a3","https://preview.redd.it/aio-my-past-and-racist-friends-has-ruined-my-relationship-v0-3j4x8c309cee1.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=1e1606c31e9a47b45a979c72c536880bb59b5141","https://preview.redd.it/aio-my-past-and-racist-friends-has-ruined-my-relationship-v0-1bcbzb309cee1.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=fd39c1e230453aa2a023ebc7f407ad7c94bbc3de","https://preview.redd.it/aio-my-past-and-racist-friends-has-ruined-my-relationship-v0-equjbc309cee1.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=8240dd84e5162b459ed209a144fec8ac46b106c6"],"videos":null,"tag":"‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π relationship","related_posts":[{"community":"amioverreacting","community_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1m4hbyj/aio_for_being_pissed_off_and_saddened_for_the_way/","title":"AIO for being pissed off and saddened for the way my friends bf treats her?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1m4hbyj/aio_for_being_pissed_off_and_saddened_for_the_way/","thumbnail":null,"num_upvotes":"416","num_comments":504},{"community":"amioverreacting","community_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1lycarz/aio_friends_new_girlfriend_sent_me_a_rude_message/","title":"AIO - Friend‚Äôs new girlfriend sent me a rude message","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1lycarz/aio_friends_new_girlfriend_sent_me_a_rude_message/","thumbnail":null,"num_upvotes":"632","num_comments":181},{"community":"amioverreacting","community_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1gnt8sp/aio_my_boyfriend_is_friend_with_a_girl_he_slept/","title":"AIO, my boyfriend is friend with a girl he slept with","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1gnt8sp/aio_my_boyfriend_is_friend_with_a_girl_he_slept/","thumbnail":null,"num_upvotes":"78","num_comments":182},{"community":"amioverreacting","community_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1m2b609/update_aio_friend_got_mad_because_i_did_not/","title":"UPDATE: AIO: Friend got mad because I did not respond to them because I was at work","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1m2b609/update_aio_friend_got_mad_because_i_did_not/","thumbnail":null,"num_upvotes":"501","num_comments":265},{"community":"amioverreacting","community_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1jfegpw/aio_i_wanted_to_share_some_good_news_with_a/","title":"AIO I wanted to share some good news with a \"friend\" and it turned into me being insensitive","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1jfegpw/aio_i_wanted_to_share_some_good_news_with_a/","thumbnail":null,"num_upvotes":"120","num_comments":158},{"community":"amioverreacting","community_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1lyccil/aio_my_bfs_friend_assaulted_me_and_he_doesnt_want/","title":"AIO- my bf‚Äôs friend assaulted me and he doesn‚Äôt want to stop being friends with him","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1lyccil/aio_my_bfs_friend_assaulted_me_and_he_doesnt_want/","thumbnail":null,"num_upvotes":"43","num_comments":99},{"community":"amioverreacting","community_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1m6fwlt/aio_is_it_time_to_end_the_relationship/","title":"AIO?

She isn‚Äôt angry at me per se but uncomfortable and didn‚Äôt know about my family being racist & me as I hadn‚Äôt been to forth coming and few other things I won‚Äôt mention. All in all she was nice and I liked the massaged and will give her the time. I‚Äôm Australian, think a few Americans got confused ahah 2 I‚Äôve dropped my parents long time ago, my older siblings( I‚Äôm 6 out of the 8) are in relationships too and don‚Äôt work expect one of their partners. They all receive Centrelink 3 AND YES deffo dropped the guy in the text 4 yes lots of mistakes biggest regret not sticking up for her that night, and letting my work friends step in for her instead. It was state of shock and majorly embarrassment because she hadn‚Äôt known any of that. 5 spoken to some of my work mates some understand the others are just idk 6 someone said she‚Äôs a snow flake‚Ä¶? Confused how that came about but ok mate üëç (her not wanting to be disrespected base on her existence alone isn‚Äôt ‚Äúsnow flake‚Äù‚Ä¶ fucking boomer) 7 saving real hard moving outta town, not trying to move to the ‚Äúrich/middle‚Äù areas just fully moving away. 8 I dropped out of school (year 11) which, yes is common in my family and for a lot of bogans (couldn‚Äôt tell you why) but I‚Äôm not illiterate. I wrote fast and was the first time I was getting everything out so my text is all over. 9 no not all aussies speak or text like this‚Ä¶ (the texts between me and old mate) it‚Äôs for some reason how most bogans/ eshays talk and what I‚Äôve grown up around pretty normal in my area unfortunately and is probably due to some illiteracy/gang talk. (Why I refer to myself/family as a bogan. Simply we are.. alotta people who are don‚Äôt say it but Ik my surroundings and also been called so my whole life ok and accepted it cause I‚Äôm moving beyond my circumstances. 10 my writing isn‚Äôt great but always doing stuff and reading etc to improve it. 11 ‚Ä¶ na I won‚Äôt go and have a beer with my ‚Äúmate‚Äù or not ditch him cause of a girl. Don‚Äôt want someone like that around. His joke wasn‚Äôt a joke what he said was fucked. End of that chat for those commenting stupid shit. 12 finally I know I‚Äôve fallen in love with her just won‚Äôt tell her and scare her. I‚Äôve rewritten a proper message and saved it to print. Sent her a text I‚Äôll leave her alone until she feels she wants to talk or needs answers and told her I have just one letter to have her read (thanks for that suggestion) 13 clarity for the night it happened. It was one friend from the old neighbourhood who came along and again was outta obligation then as he had helped me in fucked up times. I didn‚Äôt think he was gonna be like that (dumb assessment) the others were new co workers who also didn‚Äôt know about my past and stood up for her when old mate said something. He came as it came up I was having a gatho with friends and he feels we are mates (calls me brother since young) even though for me I had grown distant but we live in the same area so was hard to avoid.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1i6h75a/comment/m8io7kz/","user_commenting":"Alternative-Joke3","user_url":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Alternative-Joke3/","date_of_comment":null,"num_upvotes":2,"num_replies":1,"replies":[{"user_replying":"Suspicious-Oven1290","user_url":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Suspicious-Oven1290/","reply":"You have got this!

Nothing any random friend said to your girlfriend is going to make her break up with you. If she broke up with you it was because she chose to break up with you. At the same time though, sounds like he's assuming you're looking down on him and others because you're trying to pull your life together from a difficult upbringing. Might be true, might not. Either way, improving your life is a good and reasonable thing to do. As others have said, he might just be being jealous and feeling his own failure at being unable to do what you're doing in order to get out of the situation you grew up in together. Part of learning and growing and becoming a better person involves understanding when things are out of your control and learning not to scapegoat people. Your friend didn't make the girl leave you, the girl chose to leave you. It's entirely on her. So even if your friend is a bit of a cunt in other ways, there's no use blaming him for the girl leaving you because he didn't make her do that. Not all relationships last and it sounds like your mate might have been right about you putting a lot of stock in this girl being a sign of your life getting better. So you feel like your life is being ruined just because a girl decided to leave you. It might even be that the fact you put so much stock in the relationship with her caused her to feel uneasy around you. You might have come on too strong and treated her too much like someone on a pedestal rather than a normal person. Just some stuff to think about, but keep at it. Sounds like you've made a lot of progress and there's no point backsliding just because a girl dumped you. It'll probably happen a good few more times before you find someone that'll last long-term. That's just how relationships go.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1i6h75a/comment/m8h7eki/","user_commenting":"Flamecoat_wolf","user_url":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Flamecoat_wolf/","date_of_comment":null,"num_upvotes":-1,"num_replies":0,"replies":[]},{"comment":"I did this also.

We got a dude who used to be racist, with racist family, racist friends he still hangs out with and said racist friend says racist shit to a cool black woman and everyone's sugar coating it? Have we set the bar so low that we pat each other on the back for not being outwardly racist but perfectly fine associating with racists and in turn validating such beliefs? If you supposedly stopped being racist, why are you still fIends with racists? I mean, it goes against what you say you believe so why would you have people in your inner circle who are racist? Me personally, if I knew any friend of mine was racist/xenophobic/homophobic or hold any kind of hateful prejudice I couldn't rock with them. Unless you truly haven't gotten past it. Especially as you are seeing a black woman and a very supportive one at that. Who you keep as company reflects who you are. Secondly, you seem more upset that he's ruined your life as opposed to him being disrespectful to your partner and racist. This doesn't sit well with me. And I'm going to have to be honest, unlike alot of people on here, I'm not in the slightest bit shocked your work colleagues are acting differently around you. They probably thought you were cool up until your friend starting saying weird shit. I think it's because your friend let it be known that you say/said racist stuff and you are fine associating with people who say racist stuff. You expect her to give you another chance when you have been racist towards her in the past and still associate with people who treat her less than. Before your friend outed himself and your past you were fine hanging out with him. I don't know what you've experienced in life but it's not a nice feeling being judged before anybody has gotten to know who you are as a person. I suggest you find someone else, you could have cut ties with your racist past/friends and built a relationship with an amazing woman but you chose not to and you got exposed. I'm getting the vibe you're sorry you got exposed and not sorry for keeping certain company. You admitted yourself your friends didn't know you were dating her, why not? And why, when your friend said all that weird stuff did you not speak up then and defend your partner and correct him that you don't say racist shit? You want to talk about how not racist you are but you won't tell your friends youre dating her and you wouldn't call out your friend's bs.You've got to let this one go. You had your shot but you fucked it. She should value herself enough to move on because you didn't value her enough to be a partner.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1i6h75a/comment/m8gf0il/","user_commenting":"[deleted]","user_url":"https://www.reddit.com/svc/shreddit/comments/r/AmIOverreacting/undefined","date_of_comment":null,"num_upvotes":1,"num_replies":0,"replies":[]},{"comment":"I don't see many Aussies post in here so that's refreshing.

I showed the hairdresser my inspiration pictures and explained over and over that I liked the length and the angle of the cut, but if I had to pick one that meant the most, it would be the front length since I need to be able to pull it back for work. Throughout the consult, hair wash and was she started the cut I kept reiterating what I wanted and left up the reference pictures. I was turned from the mirrors so couldn‚Äôt quite tell what she was cutting and was shocked when she was done and my hair was done and there was no resemblance of the pictures I had shown. I was in such shock and she was the only one working so I paid, left and cried in my car. I reached out to corporate the next day explaining that what‚Äôs done is done, it can‚Äôt be glued back on so as much as I could throw a fit, I really just want this to be a learning experience for the hairdresser and make the manager aware. I also asked that it be looked at by a master stylist since it was uneven and such. The GM reached out to me one time and I spent about 2 weeks calling the store and leaving messages for her. Reached out to corporate again and do of course the GM only then reached out to me again. I had also asked for her email so we could communicate more easily. I emailed and told the GM My story and she said they‚Äôd make An appointment for me to come Get it fixed. I said I can only do after 4:30 weekdays or any time on weekends.

I‚Äôve had to wear my hair up every day because I‚Äôm self conscious of it and didn‚Äôt feel myself over the holidays because I felt I had to hide my hair. I said it‚Äôs been over a month of feeling like crud and hounding this manager to get it fixed and I was upset now. Sure enough the manager emails almost immediately and says I can Come in Saturday at 5 to have it looked at. I show up to the salon Saturday and not on the books, no one working heads to expect me and they are too packed to fit me in. I was seeing red at this point and emailed corp and the manager again. That was sat at 5:15 that I emailed and now it is Monday night and neither have gotten back to me. At this point I‚Äôll Just go somewhere else and never have to walk into Ulta again.

This year, ulta salon fried my hair. Yep. Totally fried it. They bleach it and used 30 volume on hair that hadn‚Äôt been touched in half a year, my hair became elastic, weirdly curly, and falling in clumps. I tried calling once to hint something was wrong because I actually worked there previously and didn‚Äôt want issues. But then a month or two in where every shower when I run my hands through my hair, a clump slowly comes out? I finally called crying and guess what they offer? No refund, no fix. A deep conditioning treatment. Unbelievable. I get flustered and hang up, refusing that and to come in to have people touch my hair there any further. Esp with women I worked with who were not nice to me. So I contact corporate. The most they offer is to email higher up. I‚Äôm frustrated at this point because I‚Äôve worked there and know that means nothing. So I sit there and go, what do I do? I paid 300 dollars for fried hair?! So this is what I did that made them change their tune immediately, it sounds small BUT- leave a review with pictures of your hair. Leave even the reference photos vs what you got. Explain with best grammar and to a T what has happened. When I showed the forming bald spot ( yes bald spot ) and the last clump I had, they immediately commented, contacted me, and within two days i got everything refunded except the tip. And to anyone reading, don‚Äôt go to the ulta salon. I‚Äôve had good experiences, but one bad one takes forever to fix, and I thought they were cheaper and you get points, blah blah blah. But I go to someone new who‚Äôs half the price and double the talent. Not worth the risk. My hair is still a constant work in progress to heal the damage she did, and I‚Äôve never had damaged hair until this.

I think the problem lies in that many INFJ spend a lot of our lives being the scapegoat for a lot of people who we genuinely want to help that we end up resorting to their tactics to get our way. It's like Jesus Christ (a famous INFJ and, in my opinion/research, one of the most clear examples) says: \"The path to hell is paved with good intentions.\" I think the Hitler thing is a clear example of that. Because every villain is the hero of his own story. Hitler was a vegan. Would we say all vegans are Hitler, then? He was a notable advocate of anti-smoking. Does being anti-smoking make you Hitler? I think Hitler wanted to do what he \"thought\" was right, but let his arrogance neglect the objective fact that IDK mass extermination is not good in any real word scenario? And I feel that it is indicative of many of us INFJ. We rely very sternly on our gut instincts, but don't spend enough time actually thinking through a lot of things. NiFeTiSe is our function stack, and so many of you really don't let the Ti do what it actually has to do and well....think. It's like a lot of things. Nothing is ever good in excess. Moderation leads to health. People pleasing is good, in Moderation. Following our gut is good, in Moderation Thinking is good, in Moderation. The sensory world is good, in Moderation. Excess is the death of progress. That is all I will say. And p.s. I've been told the same thing all my life by my family with the way I talk: Either I'm going to save the world, or I'm going to destroy it they would always say.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/1fe34gm/comment/lmvkgus/","user_commenting":"Lord_Of_Katz","user_url":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Lord_Of_Katz/","date_of_comment":"2024-09-13T03:40:22.324Z","num_upvotes":1,"num_replies":1,"replies":[{"user_replying":"CreepyClaim3989","user_url":"https://www.reddit.com/user/CreepyClaim3989/","reply":"I get that what u are saying i just don't like that Every time an infj does something bad people will immediately say it' is a mistyped infp why not just say it' a bad person why always say mistyped infp for unhealthy fe users behaviour .","date_of_reply":"2024-09-13T03:51:19.913Z","num_replies":0,"num_upvotes":2}]},{"comment":"INJF‚Äôs will either use their emotional intuition in pure evil or pure good.

Been trading since about 2015, mostly boring dollar cost average. I dabbled in the dark arts from time to time but never really felt confident enough to want to trade options. The past few years I‚Äôve really dove in and learned as much as I could. Traded options with a small account for a year didn‚Äôt do too bad blew it up a few times but learned a lot. During this year I was offered a an opportunity to see what I could do with 10k and 6 months. Split profit (if any) down the middle 50/50. I was told it would be a learning experience and to set a goal before I started and create a plan to achieve my goal. I set a lofty goal of 10k profit 100% gain from what I started with haha. We had meetings scheduled every 2 weeks to go over my picks and I would have to create a presentation and case for my argument. It‚Äôs been 3 months and I‚Äôve put and end to our agreement and cashing out after meeting my goal. This experience has been positive and eye opening. I can now use the money I earned to buy my girlfriend a ring. I‚Äôll be back to trading soon but for now I‚Äôm soaking in a win. I want to thank PM, LTBR, NBIS, and my baby GRRR.

In the original, 99% of Nani's problems could be solved by relatively trivial amounts of cash. She was a pretty decent caregiver, and, given Lilo's (hopefully temporary) issues, I always understood that just like only Lilo could take Stich's assholery and turn it into something productive, only Nany could help Lilo overcome the age issues. However, if Nany survives 2-3 years, and Lilo becomes a more or less adjusted student, it's smooth sailing. Hence, the logic of the original was: Stitch can't leave the island, because he's a menace to big cities, and there are none over where they live Thus, Lilo can't leave the island, because she's the force for good Nani doesn't really want to live the island either Everyone stuck; but, presumably, their monetary woes are over once and for all So I wonder how the sequel worked. Can Stitch leave even theoretically? If so, is Lilo stuck because of Stich? I mean, if Nana can afford to go to college somewhere else, presumably she can also take Lilo with her (if she wants, obviously). So why can't Lilo leave as well? Is it because Teh Government got her stuck with Stich? But if it did, it should have the courtesy to cough up some sort of cash.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CuratedTumblr/comments/1l0j34e/comment/mvi0w5l/","user_commenting":"SamsonFox2","user_url":"https://www.reddit.com/user/SamsonFox2/","date_of_comment":null,"num_upvotes":4,"num_replies":0,"replies":[]},{"comment":"In regards to the first slide, what‚Äôs even left of the film with all of that taken out?

The actresses had no chemistry, and the little interaction they did have was spent on Nani largely ignoring Lilo. Nani doesnt take Lilo to get a dog. The neighbor does. That whole scene in the original was about how much Nani loves her sister, that after overhearing how lonely she is, she decides to get her sister a dog. Lilo urges Nani to leave. The decision to abandon Lilo comes in the last 3 minutes, and feels so tacked on that it should have been cut completely. But in that, Lilo (the little girl with extreme abandonment issues) tells Nani that she should leave. \"Nani, youre so smart.\" How the fuck would you know, Lilo? This Nani doesnt even really talk to you.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CuratedTumblr/comments/1l0j34e/comment/mvgu132/","user_commenting":"westofley","user_url":"https://www.reddit.com/user/westofley/","date_of_comment":null,"num_upvotes":5,"num_replies":0,"replies":[]},{"comment":"Starting to think all these shitty live-action remakes are actually a devious strategy to rekindle interest in the original animated versions by making them look so much better in comparison.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CuratedTumblr/comments/1l0j34e/comment/mvg8qih/","user_commenting":"he77bender","user_url":"https://www.reddit.com/user/he77bender/","date_of_comment":null,"num_upvotes":7,"num_replies":0,"replies":[]}],"community_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CuratedTumblr/","community_description":"r/Tumblr but smaller and with better moderation","community_members_num":478661,"community_rank":{"community_rank_type":null,"community_rank_value":null},"post_karma":0,"bio_description":null,"embedded_links":null,"timestamp":"2025-07-26T23:18:51.207Z","input":{"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CuratedTumblr/comments/1l0j34e/ohana_means_family_you_hacks/"},"discovery_input":{"keyword":"site:reddit.com Devpost sucks bad experience","date":"Past year","num_of_posts":50,"sort_by":"Relevance"}}]
